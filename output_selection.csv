E,protein phosphatase 2a pp2a is a major intracellular protein phosphatase that regulates multiple aspects of cell growth and metabolism the ability of this widely distributed heterotrimeric enzyme to act on a diverse array of substrates is largely controlled by the nature of its regulatory b subunit only two gene families encoding endogenous b subunits have been cloned to date although the existence of several additional regulatory subunits is likely we have identified by two-hybrid interaction a new human gene family encoding pp2a b subunits this family denoted b56 contains three distinct genes one of which is differentially spliced b56 polypeptides co-immunoprecipitate with pp2a a and c subunits and with an okadaic acid-inhibitable heparin-stimulated phosphatase activity the three b56 family members are 70 identical to each other but share no obvious homology with previously identified b subunits these phosphatase regulators are differentially expressed with b56 alpha and b56 gamma highly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle and b56 beta highly expressed in brain the identification of this novel phosphatase regulator gene family will facilitate future studies on the control of protein dephosphorylation and the role of pp2a in cellular function
E,tie2 is a receptor-like tyrosine kinase expressed almost exclusively in endothelial cells and early hemopoietic cells and required for the normal development of vascular structures during embryogenesis we report the identification of a secreted ligand for tie2 termed angiopoietin-1 using a novel expression cloning technique that involves intracellular trapping and detection of the ligand in cos cells the structure of angiopoietin-1 differs from that of known angiogenic factors or other ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases although angiopoietin-1 binds and induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of tie2 it does not directly promote the growth of cultured endothelial cells however its expression in close proximity with developing blood vessels implicates angiopoietin-1 in endothelial developmental processes
E,the liver regulates the supply of amino acids required for protein synthesis and intermediary metabolism between feeding and fasting in mammals the flux of amino acids between the liver and other tissues is determined in part by the activity of specific carrier proteins we have identified a carrier of the cationic amino acids arginine lysine and ornithine in mouse liver that is closely related to a previously identified transporter with the same substrate specificity expressed in nonhepatic tissues uptake studies were performed in xenopus oocytes injected with crna encoding these proteins the comparison of the two transporters in these studies demonstrated that unlike the widely-expressed transporter arginine uptake mediated by the liver carrier is significant only at substrate concentrations that exceed systemic plasma levels and is less dependent on the intracellular concentration of cationic amino acids these properties enable hepatocytes expressing this carrier to remove excess cationic amino acids from the blood without interfering with their uptake by nonhepatic tissues that express the related transporter
E,four new members of the fibroblast growth factor fgf family referred to as fibroblast growth factor homologous factors fhfs have been identified by a combination of random cdna sequencing data base searches and degenerate pcr pairwise comparisons between the four fhfs show between 58 and 71 amino acid sequence identity but each fhf shows less than 30 identity when compared with other fgfs like fgf-1 acidic fgf and fgf-2 basic fgf the fhfs lack a classical signal sequence and contain clusters of basic residues that can act as nuclear localization signals in transiently transfected 293 cells fhf-1 accumulates in the nucleus and is not secreted each fhf is expressed in the developing and adult nervous systems suggesting a role for this branch of the fgf family in nervous system development and function
E,we have cloned the cdna of the heme-regulated eif-2 alpha kinase hri of rabbit reticulocytes in vitro translation of mrna transcribed from the hri cdna yields a 90-kda polypeptide that exhibits eif-2 alpha kinase activity and is recognized by a monoclonal antibody directed against authentic hri the open reading frame sequence of the hri cdna contains all 11 catalytic domains of protein kinases with consensus sequences of protein-serinethreonine kinases in conserved catalytic domains vi and viii the hri cdna also contains an insert of approximately 140 amino acids between catalytic domains v and vi the hri cdna coding sequence has extensive homology to gcn2 protein kinase of saccharomyces cerevisiae and to human double-stranded-rna-dependent eif-2 alpha kinase this observation suggests that gcn2 protein kinase may be an eif-2 alpha kinase in yeast in addition hri has an unusually high degree of homology to three protein kinases nima wee1 and cdc2 that are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle
E,the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses ncls represent a group of common recessive inherited neurodegenerative disorders of childhood with an incidence of 112500 live births they are characterized by accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigments in various tissues several forms of ncls have been identified based on age at onset progression of disease neurophysiological and histopathological findings and separate genetic loci all types of ncl cause progressive visual and mental decline motor disturbance epilepsy and behavioral changes and lead to premature death one of the subtypes finnish variant late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis vlincl mim256731 affects children at 4-7 years of age the first symptom is motor clumsiness followed by progressive visual failure mental and motor deterioration and later by myoclonia and seizures we have previously reported linkage for vlincl on chromosome 13 ref 5 and constructed a long-range physical map over the region here we report the positional cloning of a novel gene cln5 underlying this severe neurological disorder the gene encodes a putative transmembrane protein which shows no homology to previously reported proteins sequence analysis of dna samples from patients with three different haplotypes revealed three mutations one deletion one nonsense and one missense mutation suggesting that mutations in this gene are responsible for vlincl

E,chorea-acanthocytosis chac mim 200150 is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the gradual onset of hyperkinetic movements and abnormal erythrocyte morphology acanthocytosis neurological findings closely resemble those observed in huntington disease we identified a gene in the chac critical region and found 16 different mutations in individuals with chorea-acanthocytosis chac encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein that is probably involved in protein sorting
E,the genes encoding chain 1 ch1 and chain 2 ch2 of the major allergen of the domestic cat felis domesticus i have been analyzed by genomic cloning and by polymerase chain reaction pcr ch1 has two potential leader sequences designated a and b analysis of a genomic clone encoding ch1 demonstrated that one structural gene contains sequences corresponding to both leaders which utilize different met start codons pcr analysis showed that genes encoding ch1 and ch2 are co-expressed in both the salivary glands and the skin and that leader sequence a of ch1 is utilized preferentially in both tissues ch2 was shown to have two dominant forms that are differentially expressed in the aforementioned tissues the long form ch2l composed of 92 amino acids aa is preferentially expressed in the salivary glands while the short form ch2s composed of 90 aa is preferentially expressed in the skin there is minor sequence polymorphism in both forms of ch2 a genomic clone for ch2 only contained sequences for ch2s suggesting that ch2l is encoded by an exon not contained within this genomic clone
E,the genome of the flowering plant arabidopsis thaliana has five chromosomes here we report the sequence of the largest chromosome 1 in two contigs of around 142 and 146 megabases the contigs extend from the telomeres to the centromeric borders regions rich in transposons retrotransposons and repetitive elements such as the 180-base-pair repeat the chromosome represents 25 of the genome and contains about 6850 open reading frames 236 transfer rnas trnas and 12 small nuclear rnas there are two clusters of trna genes at different places on the chromosome one consists of 27 trnapro genes and the other contains 27 tandem repeats of trnatyr-trnatyr-trnaser genes chromosome 1 contains about 300 gene families with clustered duplications there are also many repeat elements representing 8 of the sequence
B,an approach for genome analysis based on sequencing and assembly of unselected pieces of dna from the whole chromosome has been applied to obtain the complete nucleotide sequence 1830137 base pairs of the genome from the bacterium haemophilus influenzae rd this approach eliminates the need for initial mapping efforts and is therefore applicable to the vast array of microbial species for which genome maps are unavailable the h influenzae rd genome sequence genome sequence database accession number l42023 represents the only complete genome sequence from a free-living organism
B,salmonella enterica serovar typhi s typhi is the aetiological agent of typhoid fever a serious invasive bacterial disease of humans with an annual global burden of approximately 16 million cases leading to 600000 fatalities many s enterica serovars actively invade the mucosal surface of the intestine but are normally contained in healthy individuals by the local immune defence mechanisms however s typhi has evolved the ability to spread to the deeper tissues of humans including liver spleen and bone marrow here we have sequenced the 4809037-base pair bp genome of a s typhi ct18 that is resistant to multiple drugs revealing the presence of hundreds of insertions and deletions compared with the escherichia coli genome ranging in size from single genes to large islands notably the genome sequence identifies over two hundred pseudogenes several corresponding to genes that are known to contribute to virulence in salmonella typhimurium this genetic degradation may contribute to the human-restricted host range for s typhi ct18 harbours a 218150-bp multiple-drug-resistance inch1 plasmid phcm1 and a 106516-bp cryptic plasmid phcm2 which shows recent common ancestry with a virulence plasmid of yersinia pestis
B,helicobacter pylori strain 26695 has a circular genome of 1667867 base pairs and 1590 predicted coding sequences sequence analysis indicates that h pylori has well-developed systems for motility for scavenging iron and for dna restriction and modification many putative adhesins lipoproteins and other outer membrane proteins were identified underscoring the potential complexity of host-pathogen interaction based on the large number of sequence-related genes encoding outer membrane proteins and the presence of homopolymeric tracts and dinucleotide repeats in coding sequences h pylori like several other mucosal pathogens probably uses recombination and slipped-strand mispairing within repeats as mechanisms for antigenic variation and adaptive evolution consistent with its restricted niche h pylori has a few regulatory networks and a limited metabolic repertoire and biosynthetic capacity its survival in acid conditions depends in part on its ability to establish a positive inside-membrane potential in low ph
B,the complete genome of the green-sulfur eubacterium chlorobium tepidum tls was determined to be a single circular chromosome of 2154946 bp this represents the first genome sequence from the phylum chlorobia whose members perform anoxygenic photosynthesis by the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle genome comparisons have identified genes in c tepidum that are highly conserved among photosynthetic species many of these have no assigned function and may play novel roles in photosynthesis or photobiology phylogenomic analysis reveals likely duplications of genes involved in biosynthetic pathways for photosynthesis and the metabolism of sulfur and nitrogen as well as strong similarities between metabolic processes in c tepidum and many archaeal species
B,the f tra operon region that includes genes trba traq and trbb was analyzed determination of the dna sequence showed that on the tra operon strand the trba gene begins 19 nucleotides nt distal to traf and encodes a 115-amino-acid mr-12946 protein the traq gene begins 399 nt distal to trba and encodes a 94-amino-acid mr-10867 protein the trbb gene which encodes a 179-amino-acid mr-19507 protein was found to overlap slightly with traq its start codon begins 11 nt before the traq stop codon protein analysis and subcellular fractionation of the products expressed by these genes indicated that the trbb product was processed and that the mature form of this protein accumulated in the periplasm in contrast the protein products of trba and traq appeared to be unprocessed membrane-associated proteins the dna sequence also revealed the presence of a previously unsuspected locus arta in the region between trba and traq the arta open reading frame was found to lie on the dna strand complementary to that of the f tra operon and could encode a 104-amino-acid 12132-dalton polypeptide since this sequence would not be expressed as part of the tra operon the activity of a potential arta promoter region was assessed in a galk fusion vector system in vivo utilization of the arta promoter and translational start sites was also examined by testing expression of an arta-beta-galactosidase fusion protein these results indicated that the arta gene is expressed from its own promoter
E,the finished sequence of human chromosome 20 comprises 59187298 base pairs bp and represents 994 of the euchromatic dna a single contig of 26 megabases mb spans the entire short arm and five contigs separated by gaps totalling 320 kb span the long arm of this metacentric chromosome an additional 234339 bp of sequence has been determined within the pericentromeric region of the long arm we annotated 727 genes and 168 pseudogenes in the sequence about 64 of these genes have a 5' and a 3' untranslated region and a complete open reading frame comparative analysis of the sequence of chromosome 20 to whole-genome shotgun-sequence data of two other vertebrates the mouse mus musculus and the puffer fish tetraodon nigroviridis provides an independent measure of the efficiency of gene annotation and indicates that this analysis may account for more than 95 of all coding exons and almost all genes
E,clone 120041 was selected from the est database for sequence similarity to dek and set proteins rearranged in leukemias the ends of the cdna were isolated by race technique the assembled cdna encodes an lrr-containing protein of 251 amino acids designated april acidic protein rich in leucines april has high similarity to human pp32 also named phapi bovine ipp2a1 and to rat lanp respectively april shows tissue-specific expression as shown by northern blot analysis it was localized to 15q25 by fish
E,two full-length cdnas dnlc2a and dnlc2b were cloned and characterized their open reading frames respectively encode 96 amino acids which are most closely homologous to roadblocklc7 one member of an ancient dynein light chain protein family conserved in nematode fruit fly mouse and rat the dnlc2a was expressed in 12 of 16 human tissues examined with especially strong expression in heart liver and brain whereas there was weak expression in lung prostate testis small intestine and colon the expression of dnlc2b was generally high compared with that of dnlc2a except in liver northern blotting andor semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis examined the expression changes of dnlc2a and dnlc2b in 68 hepatocellular carcinoma tissue samples it was revealed that dnlc2a was up-regulated 45 out of the 68 cases while dnlc2b was down-regulated 44 out of 68 cases compared with their adjacent tumor-free liver tissues interestingly among the total 68 liver cancer samples tested dnlc2a was up-regulated while dnlc2b was down-regulated in 28 cases dnlc2a was up-regulated while no obvious change was observed for dnlc2b in 10 cases no obvious change was observed for dnlc2a while dnlc2b was down-regulated in 14 cases although the underlying mechanism is not clear to date the apparent up-regulation of dnlc2a and down-regulation of dnlc2b suggest that these genes might be involved in tumor progression on the other hand the different expression changes of the two homologous genes indicate that hepatocellular carcinomas are caused by different pathological mechanisms in addition dnlc2a was assigned to human chromosome 20q12-q1311 near the marker d20s106 by radiation hybrid mapping
E,mutations of the degenerins deg-1 mec-4 mec-10 are the major known causes of hereditary neurodegeneration in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans we cloned a neuronal degenerin mdeg from human and rat brain mdeg is an amiloride-sensitive cation channel permeable for na k and li this channel is activated by the same mutations which cause neurodegeneration in c elegans like the hyperactive c elegans degenerin mutants constitutively active mutants of mdeg cause cell death suggesting that gain of function of this novel neuronal ion channel might be involved in human forms of neurodegeneration
E,giardia lamblia is believed to be the earliest branching derivative from the eucaryotic lineage genomic and cdna clones encoding the giardia nadp-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase have been isolated and characterized southern hydridization using genomic dna indicates that the gene encoding this activity is unique and single copy primer extension s1 nuclease protection and genomic and cdna sequence analysis demonstrate that gene transcripts are initiated within a conserved at-rich sequence element immediately preceding the atg translation initiation codon and the short 5' untranslated region is not extended by transsplicing the open reading frame is 1350 nucleotides in length and encodes a protein of 449 amino acids the reading frame is not interrupted by introns and the primary transcript is probably not subjected to rna editing in the strictly anaerobic metabolism of giardia nadp-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase activity participates along with alanine aminotransferase in the cyclic dissipation of reducing equivalents nadph through the conversion of pyruvate to alanine the deduced amino acid sequence of the giardia protein exhibits substantial homology to numerous fungal and eubacterial nadp-dependent glutamate dehydrogenases comparisons of alignment gap positions and amino acid identities indicate that the giardia sequence is at least as similar or more similar to the eubacterial sequence than it is to the fungal sequence this supports the hypothesis that giardia diverged very early from the eucaryotic lineage
E,an amplified okayama-berg plasmid cdna library was constructed from total polya rna isolated from the madin-darby bovine kidney cell line mdbk this library was screened with a partial murine calpactin i heavy chain p36 cdna clone the identification of which was based on bovine p36 tryptic peptide sequences generated during the course of these studies the largest p36 cdna insert p366 of 16 kilobase pairs was fully sequenced by the dideoxy method the dna sequence of this insert had an open reading frame of 1014 base pairs and coded for a protein with a molecular weight of 38 481 the deduced protein sequence of 338 residues was concordant with 173 residue positions of p36 determined at the protein level the 5'- and 3'-ends of p366 contained 54 and 307 base pairs of untranslated sequence respectively examination of polya rna prepared from the madin-darby cell line indicated a p36 mrna species of about 16 kilobases four regions of internal homology each about 70 amino acid residues in length were observed in the deduced protein sequence for p36 thirty-three of the 70 residue positions were conserved in at least three of the four repeating units a comparison of derived amino acid sequence for bovine p36 with that previously determined for human lipocortin wallner b p mattaliano r j hession c cate r l tizard r sinclair l k foeller c chow e p browning j l ramachandran k l 38 pepinsky r b 1986 nature london 320 77-81 revealed extensive homology 66 overall and the presence of four repetitive regions in the lipocortin structureabstract truncated at 250 words
E,enteropeptidase ec 34219 is a key enzyme in the intestinal digestion cascade responsible for the conversion of trypsinogen to trypsin which then activates various pancreatic zymogens in order to structurally characterize the enzyme we purified the enzyme from porcine duodenal mucosa and showed that it consists of three polypeptide chains which we named mini chain m chain light chain l chain and heavy chain h chain in order of increasing molecular size based on their nh2-terminal sequences a cdna clone for porcine enteropeptidase was isolated and analyzed the clone was 3597 base pairs long which encoded 1034 amino acid residues of a single-chain precursor form of enteropeptidase the precursor contained an additional nh2-terminal 51-residue sequence including a putative internal signal sequence followed by the m chain 66 residues the h chain 682 residues and the l chain 235 residues in that order the h chain had regions partially homologous in sequence with low density lipoprotein receptor and complement components on the other hand the l chain was highly homologous with the catalytic domains of trypsin-like serine proteinases the structural model of the l chain suggests that the sequence arg885-arg-arg-lys888 is probably involved in the unique substrate specificity of the enzyme preferring acidic amino acid residues at the p2-p5 sites
B,the nucleotide sequence of the citc coding for the citrate carrier in several salmonella serovars has been determined and the amino acid sequence of the carrier protein was deduced the predicted citrate carrier from salmonella pullorum and salmonella enteritidis consists of 446 amino acids with a molecular weight of 47621 whereas that from salmonella dublin is the same 446 amino acids with the slightly different molecular weight of 47591 because 1 amino acid residue was substituted the predicted proteins are highly hydrophobic 69 nonpolar amino acids the hydropathy profile suggests that the proteins are composed of 11-12 hydrophobic membrane-spanning segments with two hydrophilic cores in the middle of the protein sequence no homology in the nucleotide and amino acid sequences was found in the molecular structures of cita citp and tcti genes the citc-coding citrate transport activity is na-dependent and specific for citrate only the transcript from the citc gene was not detected in the total rna from several salmonella serovars except s dublin in northern blot analysis although the promoter of the citc genes appeared to be functional in escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium strains using the lacz fusion assay these results suggested that the citc gene-coding citrate carrier is probably a tctiii system such as that identified previously in s typhimurium
B,dna sequence analysis of a 1600-base-pair fragment located downstream of nifenx in nif region a of rhodobacter capsulatus revealed two additional open reading frames orfs orf5 encoding a ferredoxinlike protein and nifq the ferredoxinlike gene product contained two cysteine motifs typical of ferredoxins coordinating two 4fe-4s clusters but the distance between these two motifs was unusual for low-molecular-weight ferredoxins the r capsulatus nifq gene product shared a high degree of homology with klebsiella pneumoniae and azotobacter vinelandii nifq including a typical cysteine motif located in the c-terminal part nifq insertion mutants and also an orf5-nifq double deletion mutant showed normal diazotrophic growth only in the presence of high concentrations of molybdate this demonstrated that the gene encoding the ferredoxinlike protein is not essential for nitrogen fixation no nifa-activated consensus promoter could be found in the intergenic region between nifenx-orf4 and orf5-nifq analyses of a nifq-laczya fusion revealed that transcription of nifq was initiated at a promoter in front of nife in contrast to other nitrogen-fixing organisms r capsulatus nife nifn nifx orf4 orf5 and nifq were organized in one transcriptional unit
B,almost all aphid species homoptera insecta have 60-80 huge cells called bacteriocytes within which are round-shaped bacteria that are designated buchnera these bacteria are maternally transmitted to eggs and embryos through host generations and the mutualism between the host and the bacteria is so obligate that neither can reproduce independently buchnera is a close relative of escherichia coli but it contains more than 100 genomic copies per cell and its genome size is only a seventh of that of e coli here we report the complete genome sequence of buchnera sp strain aps which is composed of one 640681-base-pair chromosome and two small plasmids there are genes for the biosyntheses of amino acids essential for the hosts in the genome but those for non-essential amino acids are missing indicating complementarity and syntrophy between the host and the symbiont in addition buchnera lacks genes for the biosynthesis of cell-surface components including lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids regulator genes and genes involved in defence of the cell these results indicate that buchnera is completely symbiotic and viable only in its limited niche the bacteriocyte
E,the inferred transition from terrestrial hoofed mammal to fully aquatic cetacean has been intensively studied with fossil evidence however large sections of this remarkable evolutionary sequence are missing phylogenetic analysis of extant taxa may help to fill in some of these gaps in this report kappa-casein exon 4 and beta-casein exon 7 milk protein genes from cetaceans and other placental mammals were pcr-amplified sequenced and aligned to previously published sequences phylogenetic analyses of the casein data suggest that hippopotamid artiodactyls are more closely related to cetaceans than to other artiodactyls even-toed hoofed mammals an analysis of the nuclear casein sequences combined with published mitochondrial cytochrome b dna sequences also supports the cetaceahippopotamidae sister group this affinity implies that some of the aquatic traits of cetaceans were derived in the common ancestor of cetacea and hippopotamidae an extant missing link to cetacea may have been overlooked by science since the description of the semiaquatic hippopotamus in 1758 paleontological information is grossly inconsistent with this hypothesis if the casein phylogeny is accurate large gaps in the fossil record as well as extensive morphological reversals and convergences must be acknowledged
B,a gene capable of encoding a protein sharing 45 identical amino acids with the alpha subunit of the integration host factor ihf of escherichia coli was isolated from the photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus strain b10 by complementation of a hydrogenase-deficient hup- mutant ir4 a dna fragment of 274 base pairs containing an ihf binding consensus sequence isolated from the promoter region of the hydrogenase structural genes hupsl was shown by gel retardation assays to bind the ihf protein from e coli the product of the r capsulatus gene was shown to bind specifically to the 274-base-pair dna fragment from the hupsl promoter by analogy to the e coli hima gene which encodes the alpha subunit of ihf the gene complementing the ir4 mutant was named hima of r capsulatus the wild-type hima gene cloned in plasmid pbo2 was introduced into the ir4 strain and shown to restore in trans hydrogenase activity and autotrophic growth in the mutant in ir4 a c----t transition mutation had replaced arg-8 by cys-8 gel mobility shifts of the 274-base-pair dna fragment not observed with the hima gene product of ir4 were restored with extracts from ir4pbo2 cells containing the hima gene on the recombinant plasmid pbo2
E,mouse s-antigen clones were isolated from a mouse retinal cdna library using a bovine s-antigen cdna probe the largest clone msc-242 comprised 1532 bp and contained the entire coding sequence the nucleotide sequence homology between the mouse and bovine coding regions was 84 while non-coding regions appeared to be more divergent the deduced amino acid sequence indicated that the mouse s-antigen had 403 residues and its molecular ratio was 44930 an overall amino acid sequence similarity of 84 was observed between the mouse and bovine proteins this degree of similarity dropped to 60 and 47 at the n and the c termini respectively the local homology with alpha-transducin observed in the bovine proteins including the putative phosphoryl and rhodopsin binding sites was conserved in the mouse as well there was no overall sequence similarity with other proteins listed in the national biomedical research foundation nbrf protein sequence database among the uveitopathogenic sites for experimental autoimmune uveitis eau peptides n and m were identical to their bovine counterparts peptides 3 and k however were more divergent the short repeats within these peptides were conserved
B,comparison of two fully sequenced genomes of buchnera aphidicola the obligate endosymbionts of aphids reveals the most extreme genome stability to date no chromosome rearrangements or gene acquisitions have occurred in the past 50 to 70 million years despite substantial sequence evolution and the inactivation and loss of individual genes in contrast the genomes of their closest free-living relatives escherichia coli and salmonella spp are more than 2000-fold more labile in content and gene order the genomic stasis of b aphidicola likely attributable to the loss of phages repeated sequences and reca indicates that b aphidicola is no longer a source of ecological innovation for its hosts
B,aquifex aeolicus was one of the earliest diverging and is one of the most thermophilic bacteria known it can grow on hydrogen oxygen carbon dioxide and mineral salts the complex metabolic machinery needed for a aeolicus to function as a chemolithoautotroph an organism which uses an inorganic carbon source for biosynthesis and an inorganic chemical energy source is encoded within a genome that is only one-third the size of the e coli genome metabolic flexibility seems to be reduced as a result of the limited genome size the use of oxygen albeit at very low concentrations as an electron acceptor is allowed by the presence of a complex respiratory apparatus although this organism grows at 95 degrees c the extreme thermal limit of the bacteria only a few specific indications of thermophily are apparent from the genome here we describe the complete genome sequence of 1551335 base pairs of this evolutionarily and physiologically interesting organism
E,we have sequenced and annotated the genome of fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe which contains the smallest number of protein-coding genes yet recorded for a eukaryote 4824 the centromeres are between 35 and 110 kilobases kb and contain related repeats including a highly conserved 18-kb element regions upstream of genes are longer than in budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae possibly reflecting more-extended control regions some 43 of the genes contain introns of which there are 4730 fifty genes have significant similarity with human disease genes half of these are cancer related we identify highly conserved genes important for eukaryotic cell organization including those required for the cytoskeleton compartmentation cell-cycle control proteolysis protein phosphorylation and rna splicing these genes may have originated with the appearance of eukaryotic life few similarly conserved genes that are important for multicellular organization were identified suggesting that the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes required more new genes than did the transition from unicellular to multicellular organization
B,we present a complete dna sequence and metabolic analysis of the dominant oral bacterium fusobacterium nucleatum although not considered a major dental pathogen on its own this anaerobe facilitates the aggregation and establishment of several other species including the dental pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus the f nucleatum strain atcc 25586 genome was assembled from shotgun sequences and analyzed using the ergo bioinformatics suite httpwwwintegratedgenomicscom the genome contains 217 mb encoding 2067 open reading frames organized on a single circular chromosome with 27 gc content despite its taxonomic position among the gram-negative bacteria several features of its core metabolism are similar to that of gram-positive clostridium spp enterococcus spp and lactococcus spp the genome analysis has revealed several key aspects of the pathways of organic acid amino acid carbohydrate and lipid metabolism nine very-high-molecular-weight outer membrane proteins are predicted from the sequence none of which has been reported in the literature more than 137 transporters for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as peptides sugars metal ions and cofactors have been identified biosynthetic pathways exist for only three amino acids glutamate aspartate and asparagine the remaining amino acids are imported as such or as di- or oligopeptides that are subsequently degraded in the cytoplasm a principal source of energy appears to be the fermentation of glutamate to butyrate additionally desulfuration of cysteine and methionine yields ammonia h2s methyl mercaptan and butyrate which are capable of arresting fibroblast growth thus preventing wound healing and aiding penetration of the gingival epithelium the metabolic capabilities of f nucleatum revealed by its genome are therefore consistent with its specialized niche in the mouth
E,the subunit analogous to the d-subunit of atp synthase from bovine heart mitochondria was isolated from the purified yeast enzyme partial protein sequences were determined by direct methods from this information two oligonucleotide probes were constructed and used for screening a dna genomic bank of saccharomyces cerevisiae the sequence of yeast subunit d was deduced from the dna sequence of atp7 gene mature yeast subunit d is 173 amino acids long its nh2-terminal serine is blocked by an n-acetyl group and the protein has no processed nh2-terminal sequence other than the removal of the initiator methionine the protein is predominantly hydrophilic the amino acid sequence is 22 identical and 44 homologous to bovine subunit d a null mutant was constructed the mutant strain was unable to grow on glycerol medium the mutant mitochondria had no detectable oligomycin-sensitive atpase activity and the catalytic sector f1 was loosely bound to the membranous part the mutant mitochondria did not contain subunit d and the mitochondrially encoded hydrophobic subunit 6 was not present
B,the human gut is colonized with a vast community of indigenous microorganisms that help shape our biology here we present the complete genome sequence of the gram-negative anaerobe bacteroides thetaiotaomicron a dominant member of our normal distal intestinal microbiota its 4779-member proteome includes an elaborate apparatus for acquiring and hydrolyzing otherwise indigestible dietary polysaccharides and an associated environment-sensing system consisting of a large repertoire of extracytoplasmic function sigma factors and one- and two-component signal transduction systems these and other expanded paralogous groups shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying symbiotic host-bacterial relationships in our intestine
E,the evolution of two mitochondrial genes cytochrome b and cytochrome c oxidase subunit ii was examined in several eutherian mammal orders with special emphasis on the orders artiodactyla and rodentia when analyzed using both maximum parsimony with either equal or unequal character weighting and neighbor joining neither gene performed with a high degree of consistency in terms of the phylogenetic hypotheses supported the phylogenetic inconsistencies observed for both these genes may be the result of several factors including differences in the rate of nucleotide substitution among particular lineages especially between orders base composition bias transitiontransversion bias differences in codon usage and different constraints and levels of homoplasy associated with first second and third codon positions we discuss the implications of these findings for the molecular systematics of mammals especially as they relate to recent hypotheses concerning the polyphyly of the order rodentia relationships among the artiodactyla and various interordinal relationships
E,citrate synthase is a key enzyme of the krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle and catalyzes the stereospecific synthesis of citrate from acetyl coenzyme a and oxalacetate the amino acid sequence and three-dimensional structure of pig citrate synthase dimers are known and regions of the enzyme involved in substrate binding and catalysis have been identified a cloned complementary dna sequence encoding pig citrate synthase has been isolated from a pig kidney lambda gt11 cdna library after screening with a synthetic oligonucleotide probe the complete nucleotide sequence of the 15-kilobase cdna was determined the coding region consists of 1395 base pairs and confirms the amino acid sequence of purified pig citrate synthase the derived amino acid sequence of pig citrate synthase predicts the presence of a 27 amino acid n-terminal leader peptide whose sequence is consistent with the sequences of other mitochondrial signal peptides a conserved amino acid sequence in the mitochondrial leader peptides of pig citrate synthase and yeast mitochondrial citrate synthase was identified to express the pig citrate synthase cdna in escherichia coli we employed the inducible t7 rna polymerasepromoter double plasmid expression vectors pgp1-2 and pt7-7 tabor s 38 richardson c c 1985 proc natl acad sci usa 82 1074-1078 the pig citrate synthase cdna was modified to delete the n-terminal leader sequence then by use of a synthetic oligonucleotide linker the modified cdna was cloned into pt7-7 immediately following the initiator met a glutamate-requiring citrate synthase deficient reca- e coli mutant dek15 was transformed with pgp1-2 and then pt7-7pcs pt7-7pcs complemented the e coli glta mutationabstract truncated at 250 words
B,in the framework of the international project aimed at sequencing the bacillus subtilis bs genome a 357-kb chromosome segment around the pel locus has been cloned and sequenced this region 35745 bp 70 degrees-73 degrees of the genetic map contains two partial and 38 complete orfs a homology search for the products deduced from the 39 orfs revealed that 26 of them exhibit significant similarity to known proteins eg germination proteins sodium-alanine symporter pts system methionine amino peptidase 2-oxoglutaratemalate translocater pectate lyase general stress response protein rna helicase iron uptake and two-component systems
B,the human gut is colonized with a vast community of indigenous microorganisms that help shape our biology here we present the complete genome sequence of the gram-negative anaerobe bacteroides thetaiotaomicron a dominant member of our normal distal intestinal microbiota its 4779-member proteome includes an elaborate apparatus for acquiring and hydrolyzing otherwise indigestible dietary polysaccharides and an associated environment-sensing system consisting of a large repertoire of extracytoplasmic function sigma factors and one- and two-component signal transduction systems these and other expanded paralogous groups shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying symbiotic host-bacterial relationships in our intestine
E,fibroblast growth factor 3 fgf3 was first identified as the product of a cellular oncogene activated by mouse mammary tumour virus but its normal role appears to be in the developing embryo to gain further insights into its function we have isolated sequences encoding the fgf3 homologue in xenopus laevis xfgf3 cos-1 cells transfected with xfgf3 cdna express a 31 kda product p31 generated by signal peptide cleavage and asn-linked glycosylation at the single consensus site this product is secreted and becomes associated with the cell surface and extracellular matrix proteolytic cleavage of p31 in the extracellular compartment results in an amino-terminally truncated product p27 that is also glycosylated both p31 and p27 bind quantitatively to heparin-sepharose and can be displaced from the cell surface and extracellular matrix by soluble heparin conditioned medium containing these two proteins is capable of inducing transient morphological transformation of nih3t3 cells and of stimulating dna synthesis in quiescent c57mg and balbmk cells which express different isoforms of fgf receptors 1 and 2 since xfgf3 behaves very differently from its mouse counterpart we constructed chimeras in which amino-terminal sequences from xfgf3 were fused with carboxy-terminal sequences from mouse fgf3 increasing the contribution from mouse fgf3 led to a more restricted host range for the chimeric ligand
B,enterococcus hirae formerly streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790 has an f1f0-atpase which functions as a regulator of the cytoplasmic ph but does not synthesize atp we isolated four clones which contained genes for c b delta and alpha subunits of this enzyme but not for other subunit genes it was revealed that two specific regions upstream of the c-subunit gene and downstream of the gamma-subunit gene were lost at a specific site in the clones we isolated suggesting that these regions were unstable in escherichia coli the deleted regions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and the nucleotide sequences of these regions were determined the results showed that eight genes for a c b delta alpha gamma beta and epsilon subunits were present in this order northern rna blot analysis showed that these eight genes were transcribed to one mrna the i gene was not found in the upper region of the a-subunit gene instead of the i gene this operon contained a long untranslated region 240 bp whose g  c content was only 30 there was no typical promoter sequence such as was proposed for e coli suggesting that the promoter structure of this species is different from that of e coli deduced amino acid sequences suggested that e hirae h-atpase is a typical f1f0-type atpase but that its gene structure is not identical to that of other bacterial f1f0-atpases
E,the ocean pout macrozoarces americanus produces a set of antifreeze proteins that depresses the freezing point of its blood by binding to and inhibiting the growth of ice crystals the amino acid sequences of all the major components of the ocean pout antifreeze proteins including the immunologically distinct qae component have been derived by edman degradation in addition sequences of several minor components were deduced from dna sequencing of cdna and genomic clones fifty percent of the amino acids are perfectly conserved in all these proteins as well as in two homologous sequences from the distantly related wolffish several of the conserved residues are threonines and asparagines amino acids that have been implicated in ice binding in the structurally unrelated antifreeze protein of the righteye flounders aside from minor differences in post-translational modifications heterogeneity in antifreeze protein components stems from amino acid differences encoded by multiple genes based on genomic southern blots and library cloning statistics there are 150 copies of the 07-kilobase-long antifreeze protein gene in the newfoundland ocean pout the majority of which are closely linked but irregularly spaced a more southerly population of ocean pout from new brunswick in which the circulating antifreeze protein levels are considerably lower has approximately one-quater as many antifreeze protein genes thus there appears to be a correlation between gene dosage and antifreeze protein levels and hence the ability to survive in ice-laden seawater southern blot comparison of the two populations indicates that the differences in gene dosage were not generated by a simple set of deletionsduplications they are more likely to be the result of differential amplification
B,the 4639221-base pair sequence of escherichia coli k-12 is presented of 4288 protein-coding genes annotated 38 percent have no attributed function comparison with five other sequenced microbes reveals ubiquitous as well as narrowly distributed gene families many families of similar genes within e coli are also evident the largest family of paralogous proteins contains 80 abc transporters the genome as a whole is strikingly organized with respect to the local direction of replication guanines oligonucleotides possibly related to replication and recombination and most genes are so oriented the genome also contains insertion sequence is elements phage remnants and many other patches of unusual composition indicating genome plasticity through horizontal transfer
E,it is commonly acknowledged that cartilaginous fishes chondrichthyes have a basal position among the gnathostomata jawed vertebrates in order to explore this relationship we have sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome of the spiny dogfish squalus acanthias and included it in a phylogenetic analysis together with a number of bony fishes and amniotes the phylogenetic reconstructions placed the dogfish among the bony fishes thus and contrary to the common view the analyses have shown that the position of the sharks is not basal among the gnathostomes the presently recognized phylogenetic position of the dogfish was identified irrespective of the outgroup used echinoderms or agnathan fishes the lungfish was the most basal gnathostome fish while the teleosteans had an apical position in the piscine tree a basal position of the dogfish among the gnathostomes was statistically rejected but the phylogenetic relationship among the coelacanth spiny dogfish and teleosts was not conclusively resolved the findings challenge the current theory that sharks and other chondrichthyans if monophyletic are the sister group to all other extant gnathostomes the results open to question the status of several morphological characters commonly used in piscine phylogenetic reconstruction most notably the presence versus absence of endochondral bone in the endoskeleton the macromeric versus micromeric structure of the exoskeleton and the presenceabsence of swimbladder andor lung the study also confirmed recent findings demonstrating that the origin of the amniotes is deeper than the diversification of extant bony fishes
B,almost all aphid species homoptera insecta have 60-80 huge cells called bacteriocytes within which are round-shaped bacteria that are designated buchnera these bacteria are maternally transmitted to eggs and embryos through host generations and the mutualism between the host and the bacteria is so obligate that neither can reproduce independently buchnera is a close relative of escherichia coli but it contains more than 100 genomic copies per cell and its genome size is only a seventh of that of e coli here we report the complete genome sequence of buchnera sp strain aps which is composed of one 640681-base-pair chromosome and two small plasmids there are genes for the biosyntheses of amino acids essential for the hosts in the genome but those for non-essential amino acids are missing indicating complementarity and syntrophy between the host and the symbiont in addition buchnera lacks genes for the biosynthesis of cell-surface components including lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids regulator genes and genes involved in defence of the cell these results indicate that buchnera is completely symbiotic and viable only in its limited niche the bacteriocyte
E,three cdna clones designated 4f-8 4f-34 and 4f-41 coding for three new forms of cytochrome p450 belonging to the cyp4f subfamily were isolated from an untreated rat brain cdna library cdna 4f-8 4f-34 and 4f-41 coded for proteins of 522 526 and 537 amino acids respectively and their amino acid sequence similarity to cyp4f1 ranged from 71 to 80 these new p450s were thus named cyp4f4 4f5 and 4f6 respectively northern blot analysis revealed that the expression levels of these forms of p450 in the brain were somewhat low and that similar forms of subfamily 4f p450 were expressed in liver and kidney at a relatively high level compared with brain no cyp4a expression was detected by northern blot analysis in untreated rat brain mrna all three clones were in vitro-translatable using a reticulocyte lysate system these results show that multiple forms of subfamily 4f p450 exist in the brain and that the subfamily 4f p450 may be one of the major forms of p450 in the brain
B,here we determine the complete genomic sequence of the gram negative gamma-proteobacterium vibrio cholerae el tor n16961 to be 4033460 base pairs bp the genome consists of two circular chromosomes of 2961146 bp and 1072314 bp that together encode 3885 open reading frames the vast majority of recognizable genes for essential cell functions such as dna replication transcription translation and cell-wall biosynthesis and pathogenicity for example toxins surface antigens and adhesins are located on the large chromosome in contrast the small chromosome contains a larger fraction 59 of hypothetical genes compared with the large chromosome 42 and also contains many more genes that appear to have origins other than the gamma-proteobacteria the small chromosome also carries a gene capture system the integron island and host 'addiction' genes that are typically found on plasmids thus the small chromosome may have originally been a megaplasmid that was captured by an ancestral vibrio species the v cholerae genomic sequence provides a starting point for understanding how a free-living environmental organism emerged to become a significant human bacterial pathogen
B,the comparison of the genomes of two very closely related human mucosal pathogens mycoplasma genitalium and mycoplasma pneumoniae has helped define the essential functions of a self-replicating minimal cell as well as what constitutes a mycoplasma here we report the complete sequence of a more distant phylogenetic relative of those bacteria ureaplasma urealyticum parvum biovar which is also a mucosal pathogen of humans it is the third mycoplasma to be sequenced and has the smallest sequenced prokaryotic genome except for m genitalium although the u urealyticum genome is similar to the two sequenced mycoplasma genomes features make this organism unique among mycoplasmas and all bacteria almost all atp synthesis is the result of urea hydrolysis which generates an energy-producing electrochemical gradient some highly conserved eubacterial enzymes appear not to be encoded by u urealyticum including the cell-division protein ftsz chaperonins groes and groel and ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase u urealyticum has six closely related iron transporters which apparently arose through gene duplication suggesting that it has a kind of respiration system not present in other small genome bacteria the genome is only 255 gc in nucleotide content and the gc content of individual genes may predict how essential those genes are to ureaplasma survival
E,complementary dna clones encoding acidic and basic isoforms of tomato chitinases were isolated from cladosporium fulvum-infected leaves the clones were sequenced and found to encode the 30 kda basic intracellular and the 26 and 27 kda acidic extracellular tomato chitinases previously purified mhaj joosten et al in preparation a fourth truncated cdna which appears to encode an extracellular chitinase with 82 amino acid similarity to the 30 kda intracellular chitinase was also isolated characterization of the clones revealed that the 30 kda basic intracellular protein is a class i chitinase and that the 26 and 27 kda acidic extracellular proteins which have 85 peptide sequence similarity are class ii chitinases the characterized cdna clones represent four from a family of at least six tomato chitinases southern blot analysis indicated that with the exception of the 30 kda basic intracellular chitinase the tomato chitinases are encoded by one or two genes northern blot analysis showed that the mrna encoding the 26 kda acidic extracellular chitinase is induced more rapidly during an incompatible c fulvum-tomato interaction than during a compatible interaction this difference in timing of mrna induction was not observed for the 30 kda basic intracellular chitinase
E,as a base for human transcriptome and functional genomics we created the full-length long japan flj collection of sequenced human cdnas we determined the entire sequence of 21243 selected clones and found that 14490 cdnas 10897 clusters were unique to the flj collection about half of them 5416 seemed to be protein-coding of those 1999 clusters had not been predicted by computational methods the distribution of gc content of nonpredicted cdnas had a peak at approximately 58 compared with a peak at approximately 42for predicted cdnas thus there seems to be a slight bias against gc-rich transcripts in current gene prediction procedures the rest of the cdnas unique to the flj collection 5481 contained no obvious open reading frames orfs and thus are candidate noncoding rnas about one-fourth of them 1378 showed a clear pattern of splicing the distribution of gc content of noncoding cdnas was narrow and had a peak at approximately 42 relatively low compared with that of protein-coding cdnas
B,the gene coding for the carotenoid biosynthesis enzyme phytoene synthase pys has been cloned from the unicellular cyanobacterium synechocystis sp pcc6803 the gene has been functionally expressed in escherichia coli where it directs the biosynthesis of phytoene from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate ggpp analysis of the sequence of the synechocystis pys protein deduced from the gene sequence shows that it is highly homologous to the tomato and synechococcus phytoene synthases and shows conserved domains with other bacterial phytoene synthase enzymes the pys gene starts 60 nucleotides downstream of the pds gene which codes for phytoene desaturase however it seems to be transcribed mainly from its own promoters because insertions that disrupt the pds gene do not affect significantly the expression of the pys gene
E,the national institutes of health mammalian gene collection mgc program is a multiinstitutional effort to identify and sequence a cdna clone containing a complete orf for each human and mouse gene ests were generated from libraries enriched for full-length cdnas and analyzed to identify candidate full-orf clones which then were sequenced to high accuracy the mgc has currently sequenced and verified the full orf for a nonredundant set of 9000 human and 6000 mouse genes candidate full-orf clones for an additional 7800 human and 3500 mouse genes also have been identified all mgc sequences and clones are available without restriction through public databases and clone distribution networks see httpmgcncinihgov
E,the finished sequence of human chromosome 20 comprises 59187298 base pairs bp and represents 994 of the euchromatic dna a single contig of 26 megabases mb spans the entire short arm and five contigs separated by gaps totalling 320 kb span the long arm of this metacentric chromosome an additional 234339 bp of sequence has been determined within the pericentromeric region of the long arm we annotated 727 genes and 168 pseudogenes in the sequence about 64 of these genes have a 5' and a 3' untranslated region and a complete open reading frame comparative analysis of the sequence of chromosome 20 to whole-genome shotgun-sequence data of two other vertebrates the mouse mus musculus and the puffer fish tetraodon nigroviridis provides an independent measure of the efficiency of gene annotation and indicates that this analysis may account for more than 95 of all coding exons and almost all genes
E,proteins were purified from the carapace cuticle of a juvenile horseshoe crab limulus polyphemus and several of them were characterized by amino acid sequence determination the proteins are small 7-16 kda and their isoelectric points range from 65 to 92 they have high contents of tyrosine ranging from 135 to 354 some of the proteins show sequence similarity to cuticular proteins from other arthropod groups with the most pronounced similarity to proteins from the cuticle of the spider araneus diadematus two proteins show sequence similarity to a hexamerin storage protein from blaberus discoidalis
B,prochlorococcus marinus the dominant photosynthetic organism in the ocean is found in two main ecological forms high-light-adapted genotypes in the upper part of the water column and low-light-adapted genotypes at the bottom of the illuminated layer p marinus ss120 the complete genome sequence reported here is an extremely low-light-adapted form the genome of p marinus ss120 is composed of a single circular chromosome of 1751080 bp with an average gc content of 364 it contains 1884 predicted protein-coding genes with an average size of 825 bp a single rrna operon and 40 trna genes together with the 166-mbp genome of p marinus med4 the genome of p marinus ss120 is one of the two smallest genomes of a photosynthetic organism known to date it lacks many genes that are involved in photosynthesis dna repair solute uptake intermediary metabolism motility phototaxis and other functions that are conserved among other cyanobacteria systems of signal transduction and environmental stress response show a particularly drastic reduction in the number of components even taking into account the small size of the ss120 genome in contrast housekeeping genes which encode enzymes of amino acid nucleotide cofactor and cell wall biosynthesis are all present because of its remarkable compactness the genome of p marinus ss120 might approximate the minimal gene complement of a photosynthetic organism
E,acetylcholine ach plays a key role in the transitions between the different phases of sleep slow-wave sleep requires low ach concentrations in the brain whereas rapid-eye-movement rem sleep is associated with high levels of ach also these phases of sleep are differentially sensitive to a number of endogenous neuropeptides and cytokines including somatostatin which has been shown to increase rem sleep without significantly affecting other phases here we report the cloning and initial characterization of cortistatin a neuropeptide that exhibits strong structural similarity to somatostatin although it is the product of a different gene administration of cortistatin depresses neuronal electrical activity but unlike somatostatin induces low-frequency waves in the cerebral cortex and antagonizes the effects of acetylcholine on hippocampal and cortical measures of excitability this suggests a mechanism for cortical synchronization related to sleep
E,a cdna sequence related to the human cytochrome p-450 responsible for s-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation p-450mp has been isolated from a human liver bacteriophage lambda gt11 library with antibodies specific for p-450mp the total length of the cdna is 25 kilobases kb of which there is a 16-kb ecori fragment coding for all but five amino acids corresponding to the n-terminus of the protein and including a small noncoding region at the 3' end this 16-kb fragment has been sequenced and used as a probe to analyze human genomic dna and liver rna the sequence shows extensive sequence similarity with that of rabbit liver cytochrome p-450 progesterone 21-hydroxylase tukey r h okino s barnes h griffin k j 38 johnson e f 1985 j biol chem 260 13347-13354 and this cdna like the rabbit clone appears to be part of a multigene family at least two liver mrna species 22 kb and 35 kb hybridize to the cdna sequence the cloning of this gene should aid in analyzing the molecular basis for the genetic polymorphism of s-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation reported in humans
E,dnaj is a 36-kd heat shock protein that functions together with dnak hsp70 as a molecular chaperone in escherichia coli we have obtained a cdna clone from the higher plant atriplex nummularia that encodes a 466-kd polypeptide anj1 with an overall 352 amino acid sequence identity with the e coli dnaj anj1 has 434 overall sequence identity with the saccharomyces cerevisiae cytoplasmic dnaj homolog ydj1mas5 complementation of the yeast mas5 mutation indicated that anj1 is a functional homolog of ydj1mas5 the presence of other dnaj homologs in a nummularia was demonstrated by the detection of proteins that are antigenically related to the yeast mitochondrial dnaj homolog scj1 and the yeast dnaj-related protein sec63 expression of the anj1 gene was compared with that of an a nummularia hsp70 gene expression of both anj1 and hsp70 transcripts was coordinately induced by heat shock however noncoordinate accumulation of anj1 and hsp70 mrnas occurred during the cell growth cycle and in response to nacl stress
B,pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that is one of the top three causes of opportunistic human infections a major factor in its prominence as a pathogen is its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants here we report the complete sequence of p aeruginosa strain pao1 at 63 million base pairs this is the largest bacterial genome sequenced and the sequence provides insights into the basis of the versatility and intrinsic drug resistance of p aeruginosa consistent with its larger genome size and environmental adaptability p aeruginosa contains the highest proportion of regulatory genes observed for a bacterial genome and a large number of genes involved in the catabolism transport and efflux of organic compounds as well as four potential chemotaxis systems we propose that the size and complexity of the p aeruginosa genome reflect an evolutionary adaptation permitting it to thrive in diverse environments and resist the effects of a variety of antimicrobial substances
B,the nucleotide sequences of three independent fragments designated no 3 4 and 9 each 15-20 kb in size of the genome of alkaliphilic bacillus sp c-125 cloned in a lambda phage vector have been determined thirteen putative open reading frames orfs were identified in sequenced fragment no 3 and 11 orfs were identified in no 4 twenty orfs were also identified in fragment no 9 all putative orfs were analyzed in comparison with the bsorf database and non-redundant protein databases the functions of 5 orfs in fragment no 3 and 3 orfs in fragment no 4 were suggested by their significant similarities to known proteins in the database among the 20 orfs in fragment no 9 the functions of 11 orfs were similarly suggested most of the annotated orfs in the dna fragments of the genome of alkaliphilic bacillus sp c-125 were conserved in the bacillus subtilis genome the organization of orfs in the genome of strain c-125 was found to differ from the order of genes in the chromosome of b subtilis although some gene clusters ydh yqi yer and yts were conserved as operon units the same as in b subtilis
E,in clams fertilization is followed by the prominent synthesis of two cyclins a and b during the mitotic cell cycles the two cyclins are accumulated and then destroyed near the end of each metaphase newly synthesized cyclin b is complexed with a small set of other proteins including a kinase that phosphorylates cyclin b in vitro while both cyclins can act as general inducers of entry into m phase the two are clearly distinguished by their amino acid sequences 70 nonidentity and by their different modes of expression in oocytes and during meiosis in contrast to cyclin a which is stored solely as maternal mrna oocytes contain a stockpile of cyclin b protein which is stored in large rapidly sedimenting aggregates fertilization results in the release of cyclin b to a more disperse soluble form since the first meiotic division in clams can proceed even when new protein synthesis is blocked these results strongly suggest it is the fertilization-triggered unmasking of cyclin b protein that drives cells into meiosis i we propose that the unmasking of maternal cyclin b protein allows it to interact with cdc2 protein kinase which is also stored in oocytes and that the formation of this cyclin bcdc2 complex generates active m phase-promoting factor
B,bordetella pertussis bordetella parapertussis and bordetella bronchiseptica are closely related gram-negative beta-proteobacteria that colonize the respiratory tracts of mammals b pertussis is a strict human pathogen of recent evolutionary origin and is the primary etiologic agent of whooping cough b parapertussis can also cause whooping cough and b bronchiseptica causes chronic respiratory infections in a wide range of animals we sequenced the genomes of b bronchiseptica rb50 5338400 bp 5007 predicted genes b parapertussis 12822 4773551 bp 4404 genes and b pertussis tohama i 4086186 bp 3816 genes our analysis indicates that b parapertussis and b pertussis are independent derivatives of b bronchiseptica-like ancestors during the evolution of these two host-restricted species there was large-scale gene loss and inactivation host adaptation seems to be a consequence of loss not gain of function and differences in virulence may be related to loss of regulatory or control functions
E,cytochrome p450c17 is a key steroidogenic enzyme for the production of sex steroids in gonadal tissue and for cortisol production in adrenal tissue this protein possesses two enzymatic activities the 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity results in the introduction of a hydroxyl group at the 17 alpha-position the resultant 17 alpha-hydroxylated c21 pregnene is converted to a c19 androgen by the c1720-lyase activity a cdna library was constructed from polya-enriched mrna isolated from spiny dogfish shark squalus acanthias testis and ligated into ecori-cut lambda arms the amplified library was screened using a bovine p450c17 cdna probe and five positive clones were isolated the described cdna encompasses 23 bp of the 5'-untranslated region a 1527 bp open reading frame and 414 bp of the 3'-untranslated region a putative polyadenylation signal aataaa is 18 bp from the polya tail northern blot analysis showed a single transcript of 19 kb thus indicating the isolated clone is a full-length cdna the deduced amino acid sequence of the shark form of p450c17 is 59 and 57 identical to the rainbow trout and chicken forms respectively the shark form is 43 to 46 identical to mammalian forms rat human mouse bovine and porcine there are large regions of extremely high identity shared among all the forms the deduced shark 17 alpha-hydroxylase protein is 509 residues in length with a predicted weight of 572 kda non-steroidogenic cos cells transfected with the shark p450c17 cdna was capable of 17 alpha-hydroxylase and c1720-lyase activities using both pregnenolone and progesterone as initial substrates
B,almost all aphid species homoptera insecta have 60-80 huge cells called bacteriocytes within which are round-shaped bacteria that are designated buchnera these bacteria are maternally transmitted to eggs and embryos through host generations and the mutualism between the host and the bacteria is so obligate that neither can reproduce independently buchnera is a close relative of escherichia coli but it contains more than 100 genomic copies per cell and its genome size is only a seventh of that of e coli here we report the complete genome sequence of buchnera sp strain aps which is composed of one 640681-base-pair chromosome and two small plasmids there are genes for the biosyntheses of amino acids essential for the hosts in the genome but those for non-essential amino acids are missing indicating complementarity and syntrophy between the host and the symbiont in addition buchnera lacks genes for the biosynthesis of cell-surface components including lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids regulator genes and genes involved in defence of the cell these results indicate that buchnera is completely symbiotic and viable only in its limited niche the bacteriocyte
B,photorhabdus luminescens is a symbiont of nematodes and a broad-spectrum insect pathogen the complete genome sequence of strain tt01 is 5688987 base pairs bp long and contains 4839 predicted protein-coding genes strikingly it encodes a large number of adhesins toxins hemolysins proteases and lipases and contains a wide array of antibiotic synthesizing genes these proteins are likely to play a role in the elimination of competitors host colonization invasion and bioconversion of the insect cadaver making p luminescens a promising model for the study of symbiosis and host-pathogen interactions comparison with the genomes of related bacteria reveals the acquisition of virulence factors by extensive horizontal transfer and provides clues about the evolution of an insect pathogen moreover newly identified insecticidal proteins may be effective alternatives for the control of insect pests
E,proteins were purified from the carapace cuticle of a juvenile horseshoe crab limulus polyphemus and several of them were characterized by amino acid sequence determination the proteins are small 7-16 kda and their isoelectric points range from 65 to 92 they have high contents of tyrosine ranging from 135 to 354 some of the proteins show sequence similarity to cuticular proteins from other arthropod groups with the most pronounced similarity to proteins from the cuticle of the spider araneus diadematus two proteins show sequence similarity to a hexamerin storage protein from blaberus discoidalis
B,the pyruvate dehydrogenase pdh complex of the gram-negative bacterium zymomonas mobilis was purified to homogeneity from 250 g of cells we isolated 1 mg of pdh complex with a specific activity of 126 umg of protein analysis of subunit composition revealed a pdh e1 consisting of the two subunits e1alpha 38 kda and e1beta 56 kda a dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase e2 of 48 kda and a lipoamide dehydrogenase e3 of 50 kda the e2 core of the complex is arranged to form a pentagonal dodecahedron as shown by electron microscopic images resembling the quaternary structures of pdh complexes from gram-positive bacteria and eukaryotes the pdh complex-encoding genes were identified by hybridization experiments and sequence analysis in two separate gene regions in the genome of z mobilis the genes pdhaalpha 1065 bp and pdhabeta 1389 bp encoding the e1alpha and e1beta subunits of the e1 component were located downstream of the gene encoding enolase the pdhb 1323 bp and lpd 1401 bp genes encoding the e2 and e3 components were identified in an unrelated gene region together with a 450-bp open reading frame orf of unknown function in the order pdhb-orf2-lpd highest similarities of the gene products of the pdhaalpha pdhabeta and pdhb genes were found with the corresponding enzymes of saccharomyces cerevisiae and other eukaryotes like the dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferases of s cerevisiae and numerous other organisms the product of the pdhb gene contains a single lipoyl domain the e1beta subunit pdh was found to contain an amino-terminal lipoyl domain a property which is unique among pdhs
E,phylogenetic analysis of conservative nucleotide substitutions in 18 complete sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of phocidae true seals odobenidae walruses and otariidae sea lions and fur seals plus three ursid and three felid sequences identified the pinnipeds as monophyletic with otariidae and odobenidae on a common evolutionary branch analysis of total nucleotide differences separated the evolutionary lineages of northern and southern phocids both lineages are distinct from the most ancestral phocid genus monachus monk seals represented by the hawaiian monk seal the inclusion of the hawaiian monk seal in the subfamily monachinae makes the subfamily paraphyletic among the northern phocids the hooded seal genus cystophora chromosome number 2n  34 is sister taxon to the phoca complex the phoca complex which is characterized by the chromosome number 2n  32 includes genus phoca and the monotypic genus halichoerus grey seal the comparison does not support a generic distinction of halichoerus within the phoca complex the present data suggest that cystophora and phoca separated  or  6 million years ago among the southern phocids the close molecular relationship of the weddell and leopard seals relative to their morphological distinction exemplifies rapid adaptation to different ecological niches this result stands in contrast to the limited morphological differentiation relative to the pronounced molecular distinctions that may occur within the phoca complex
E,we previously isolated a dna fragment from arabidopsis thaliana homologous to the mammalian ras gene and named it ara matsui et al gene 76 1989 313-319 screening of cdna clones homologous to ara in a thaliana resulted in the isolation of four homologous genes the products of these genes ara-2 ara-3 ara-4 and ara-5 showed conservation of amino acids aa in four regions all of which are present in small gtp-binding proteins and are important for gtpasegtp-binding activities these products were highly homologous to those of the ypt genes of saccharomyces cerevisiae and the ypt gene of schizosaccharomyces pombe in the regions around aa 45 which is thought to be the site interacting with effector molecules the products of these four genes showed characteristic aa sequence at their c termini cys-cys-xaa-xaa another characteristic of this family is presence of ser in place of gly in the first conserved region gly12 of mammalian gtp-binding ras protein
B,x-ray analysis of three-dimensional crystals of the photosynthetic reaction center from the purple bacterium rhodopseudomonas viridis led to an electron density distribution at 3 a resolution calculated with phases from multiple isomorphous replacement the protein subunits of the complex were identified an atomic model of the prosthetic groups of the reaction center complex 4 bacteriochlorophyll b 2 bacteriopheophytin b 1 non-heme iron 1 menaquinone 4 heme groups was built the arrangement of the ring systems of the bacteriochlorophyll b and bacteriopheophytin b molecules shows a local 2-fold rotation symmetry two bacteriochlorophyll b form a closely associated non-covalently linked dimer special pair a different local 2-fold symmetry axis is observed for the heme groups of the cytochrome part
E,the national institutes of health mammalian gene collection mgc program is a multiinstitutional effort to identify and sequence a cdna clone containing a complete orf for each human and mouse gene ests were generated from libraries enriched for full-length cdnas and analyzed to identify candidate full-orf clones which then were sequenced to high accuracy the mgc has currently sequenced and verified the full orf for a nonredundant set of 9000 human and 6000 mouse genes candidate full-orf clones for an additional 7800 human and 3500 mouse genes also have been identified all mgc sequences and clones are available without restriction through public databases and clone distribution networks see httpmgcncinihgov
V,we have performed large-scale random oligonucleotide insertion mutagenesis on a 41-kbp genomic segment derived from the unique long ul region of the alphaherpesvirus pseudorabies virus prv this procedure has resulted in the generation of a series of prv strains each carrying a single gene whose termination of translation is induced by the inserted oligonucleotide to relate the genes that were involved in the mutagenization to genes previously identified in herpes simplex virus type 1 the prototype alphaherpesvirus we have performed cross-hybridization studies in this way we have mapped the location of the homolog of a gene which was described to have sequence characteristics of a eukaryotic phosphotransferase we characterized the phenotype of a mutant prv strain lacking this putative phosphotransferase also the phenotype of a prv strain lacking in addition to the ul-encoded putative phosphotransferase the protein kinase encoded within the unique short region of the virus to assess the enzymatic activity of the ul region-encoded phosphotransferase we expressed the gene transiently in a eukaryotic expression system immunoprecipitation of the protein followed by kinase assays and phosphoamino acid analyses revealed protein-serinethreonine kinase activity implications of sequence divergence of this protein from classical protein-serinethreonine kinases for kinase structure and function are discussed in view of the recent resolution of the structure of the catalytic domain of cyclic amp-dependent protein kinase
B,previous studies have shown that several bacterial species exhibit a multigenic response following temperature downshift cold shock evidence for such a response in salmonella typhimurium is reported based on the isolation of a range of low-induction-temperature gene fusions containing mudlux insertions the fusions exhibited different levels of basal light at 30 degrees c and were induced at different rates and to different degrees over several hours following a reduction in temperature to 10 degrees c of the mudlux gene fusions isolated one was found which produced essentially no light when grown at 30 degrees c but exhibited rapid and high-level induction when the temperature was reduced to 10 degrees c the target of this gene fusion which was named cspb was shown to lie adjacent to the umudc operon and to encode a homologue of the major cold-shock protein of escherichia coli cspa luminescence studies revealed that substantial light production occurred from the cspbmudlux fusion at or below 22 degrees c but not at higher temperatures even following a temperature drop from 30 degrees c moreover cspb mrna levels were found to mimic this pattern of luminescence suggesting that cspb expression occurs below a defined temperature threshold the cspb mrna was also found to be very stable at 10 degrees c but to become highly unstable when the temperature was raised towards the threshold temperature even in the presence of rifampicin existing cellular rnases therefore appear to mediate the decay of cspb mrna at high temperatures but are incapable of this at low temperatures
E,the enzyme 8-oxo-78-dihydrodeoxyguanosine triphosphatase 8-oxo-dgtpase is present in various organisms and plays an important role in control of spontaneous mutagenesis this enzyme degrades 8-oxoguanine-containing deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate a potentially mutagenic substrate for dna synthesis to the corresponding monophosphate to obtain appropriate probes for expression of the gene in various tissues and also to construct appropriate experimental models for carcinogenesis we cloned cdna for rat 8-oxo-dgtpase and elucidated its structure the nucleotide sequence of the cdna revealed that the rat 8-oxo-dgtpase protein is composed of 156 amino acid residues the molecular weight of rat 8-oxo-dgtpase calculated from the predicted amino acid sequence was 18006 and the 8-oxo-dgtpase protein of this size was detected when the cdna was expressed in 8-oxo-dgtpase-deficient escherichia coli mutt- cells the predicted amino acid sequence of the rat 8-oxo-dgtpase has a close homology with those of human and bacterial counterparts using the cdna as a probe part of the rat gene for 8-oxo-dgtpase was isolated and was found to consist of at least three exons and spanned about 10 kb a genomic region containing the pseudogene was also isolated
B,the symbiotic nitrogen-fixing soil bacterium sinorhizobium meliloti contains three replicons psyma psymb and the chromosome we report here the complete 1354226-nt sequence of psyma in addition to a large fraction of the genes known to be specifically involved in symbiosis psyma contains genes likely to be involved in nitrogen and carbon metabolism transport stress and resistance responses and other functions that give s meliloti an advantage in its specialized niche
E,activin is a member of the transforming growth factor beta tgf-beta and possesses various activities in cellular control phenomena during xenopus embryonic development activin is thought to act as a natural mesoderm-inducing factor we isolated here the xenopus activin receptor cdna from xenopus tadpole cdna library and examined the expression of the xenopus activin receptor gene during the course of early embryonic development the xenopus activin receptor has an 87 homology at the level of deduced amino acid sequence with the mouse activin receptor and using the cdna obtained three bands of mrna with different lengths were detected in xenopus embryos throughout early embryogenesis we synthesized activin receptor mrna in vitro and tested the effect of the injection of the mrna into xenopus fertilized eggs on subsequent development when the synthetic mrna was injected into uncleaved fertilized eggs embryos with reduced trunk structure were formed however when the mrna was injected into the ventral blastomeres at the 16-cell stage embryos with a secondary body axis were formed these results indicate the importance of the function of activin receptor in the regulatory mechanism for body axis formation
E,proopiomelanocortin pomc is the precursor for a number of biologically active peptides such as adrenocorticotropic hormone acth alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone alpha-msh and beta-endorphin it is well known that these peptides are involved in the stress response in fish as well as in mammals we have cloned two different carp pomc cdnas called pomc-i and pomc-ii the nucleotide sequences of 955 bp for pomc-i and 959 bp for pomc-ii share 935 identity in their cdnas and the deduced amino acid sequences both 222 amino acids are 914 identical in the acth and beta-msh domain two amino acid substitutions are found whereas alpha-msh and beta-endorphin are identical for beta-msh the serine replacement in pomc-i by a glycine in pomc-ii results in a putative amidation site pro-x-gly for pomc-ii we used rt-pcr to show that both pomc mrnas are expressed in the hypophysis hypothalamus and other parts of the brain of a single fish furthermore in a phylogenetic tree based on pomc sequences the divergence of carp pomc-i and -ii from tetraploid animals salmon trout and xenopus is demonstrated
B,the genome sequence of the solvent-producing bacterium clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 has been determined by the shotgun approach the genome consists of a 394-mb chromosome and a 192-kb megaplasmid that contains the majority of genes responsible for solvent production comparison of c acetobutylicum to bacillus subtilis reveals significant local conservation of gene order which has not been seen in comparisons of other genomes with similar or in some cases closer phylogenetic proximity this conservation allows the prediction of many previously undetected operons in both bacteria however the c acetobutylicum genome also contains a significant number of predicted operons that are shared with distantly related bacteria and archaea but not with b subtilis phylogenetic analysis is compatible with the dissemination of such operons by horizontal transfer the enzymes of the solventogenesis pathway and of the cellulosome of c acetobutylicum comprise a new set of metabolic capacities not previously represented in the collection of complete genomes these enzymes show a complex pattern of evolutionary affinities emphasizing the role of lateral gene exchange in the evolution of the unique metabolic profile of the bacterium many of the sporulation genes identified in b subtilis are missing in c acetobutylicum which suggests major differences in the sporulation process thus comparative analysis reveals both significant conservation of the genome organization and pronounced differences in many systems that reflect unique adaptive strategies of the two gram-positive bacteria
B,countless millions of people have died from tuberculosis a chronic infectious disease caused by the tubercle bacillus the complete genome sequence of the best-characterized strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv has been determined and analysed in order to improve our understanding of the biology of this slow-growing pathogen and to help the conception of new prophylactic and therapeutic interventions the genome comprises 4411529 base pairs contains around 4000 genes and has a very high guanine  cytosine content that is reflected in the blased amino-acid content of the proteins m tuberculosis differs radically from other bacteria in that a very large portion of its coding capacity is devoted to the production of enzymes involved in lipogenesis and lipolysis and to two new families of glycine-rich proteins with a repetitive structure that may represent a source of antigenic variation
E,isolation of the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone chh from the eyestalk of the giant freshwater prawn macrobrachium rosenbergii was performed using 5000 ground eye-stalks extracted in methanol-acetic acid-water 9019 after the extract was partially purified using c18 cartridges it was further purified by eight steps of rp-hplc using four kinds of columns c18 c8 cyano and phenyl and three solvent systems acetonitrile acntrifluoroacetic acid acnheptafluoroacetic acid and acntriethylammonium acetate the bioassay of chh during purification was done by injection of eluate fractions into eyestalk-ablated prawns and determination of the ability of the fractions to elevate glucose in the haemolymph a complete amino acid sequence analysis was performed on one isoform of chh mar-chh-1 consisting of 71 residues the sequence of mar-chh-1 shows considerable similarity 45-68 to chhs reported in other crustaceans it is expected that there might be more than one isoform of chh in m rosenbergii
E,the complete mitochondrial dna mtdna 16896 nt of the wallaroo macropus robustus was sequenced the concatenated amino acid sequences of 12 mitochondrial protein-coding genes of the wallaroo plus those of a number of other mammals were included in a phylogenetic study of early mammalian divergences the analysis joined monotremes and marsupials the marsupionta hypothesis to the exclusion of eutherians the analysis rejected significantly the commonly acknowledged theria hypothesis according to which marsupialia and eutheria are grouped together to the exclusion of monotremata the region harboring the gene for lysine trna trna-lys in the mtdna of other vertebrates is in the wallaroo occupied by a sequence trna-lys that lacks both an anticodon loop as well as the anticodon for the amino acid lysine an alternative trna-lys gene was not identified in any other region of the mtdna of the wallaroo suggesting that a trna-lys of nuclear origin is imported into marsupial mitochondria previously described rna editing of trna-asp and rearrangement of some trna genes were reconfirmed in the mtdna of the wallaroo the divergence between monotrematamarsupialia and eutheria was timed to approximately 130 million years before present mybp the same calculations suggested that monotremata and marsupialia diverged approximately 115 mybp and that australian and american marsupials separated approximately 75 mybp the findings also show that many probably most extant eutherian orders had their origin in middle to late cretaceous times 115-65 mybp
E,we have cloned and sequenced a 5200 base restriction fragment and an overlapping 3100 base fragment of the large single copy region of the chloroplast genome of the diatom odontella sinensis which hybridized to several atpase gene probes these fragments contain six closely linked reading frames that were identified as atpi atph atpg atpf atpd and atpa coding for subunits iv iii ii i delta and alpha respectively remarkably the genes atpg and atpd which are nucleus-encoded in chlorophyll a  b plants are present in the odontella chloroplast gene cluster they map at the same positions as in cyanobacteria the genes atpd and atpf overlap by four base-pairs as in certain photosynthetic and heterotrophic eubacteria upstream from the atpa gene cluster an open reading frame coding for 251 amino acid residues was found which shows sequence similarity to atp-binding subunits of periplasmic prokaryotic and eukaryotic transport systems no similar reading frame is present in the land plant chloroplast genomes analysed so far sequences and arrangement of the genes are discussed with respect to the peculiar evolution of the chlorophyll a  c-containing chromophytic plastids
E,to elucidate the evolutionary relationship between the spermatophyta pteridophyta and bryophyta we cloned a fragment of chloroplast dna from the fern angiopteris lygodiifolia pteridophyta and determined its nucleotide sequence the fragment contained the atpb rbcl trnr-ccg dedb and psai genes comparisons of the deduced amino acid and nucleotide sequences of these genes from the three plant groups indicate that angiopteris sequences are more closely related to those of bryophyta species 85 identity on average than to those of seed plants 76 identity on average supporting a hypothesis that the bryophyta and pteridophyta diverged more recently from one another than their common progenitor diverged from that of the spermatophyta
A,a dissimilatory sulphite reductase was isolated from the extremely thermophilic dissimilatory sulphate-reducing archaeon archaeoglobus fulgidus in common with other dissimilatory sulphite reductases thus far characterized the enzyme has an alpha 2 beta 2-structure and contains sirohaem non-haem iron atoms and acid labile sulphide the oxidized enzyme exhibited absorption maxima at 281 394 545 and 593 nm with a weak band around 715 nm we have cloned and sequenced the genes for the alpha and beta subunits of this enzyme which we designate dsra and dsrb respectively they are contiguous in the order dsra dsrb and probably comprise an operon since dsra is preceded by sequences characteristic of promoters in methanogenic archaea and dsrb is followed by a sequence resembling termination signals in extremely thermophilic sulphur-dependent archaea dsra and dsrb encode 474 kda and 417 kda peptides which have 256 amino acid sequence identity indicating that they may have arisen by duplication of an ancestral gene each deduced peptide contains cysteine clusters resembling those postulated to bind sirohaem-fe4s4 complexes in sulphite reductases and nitrite reductases from other species the dsrb encoded peptide lacks a single cysteine residue in one of the two clusters suggesting that only the alpha subunit binds a sirohaem-fe4s4 complex and chemical analyses showed the presence of only two sirohaems per alpha 2 beta 2 enzyme molecule both deduced peptides also contain an arrangement of cysteine residues characteristic of fe4s4 ferredoxins and chemical analyses were consistent with the presence of six fe4s4 clusters per alpha 2 beta 2 enzyme molecule two of which would be expected to be associated with sirohaem while the other four could bind to the ferredoxin-like sites
B,the nucleotide sequence of a 1 kb fragment upstream of azorhizobium caulinodans fixl was established an open reading frame of 744 bp was identified as a fixk homologue a kanamycin cartridge was inserted into the cloned fixk-like gene and recombined into the host genome the resulting mutant was nif-fix- suggesting that fixk was required for nitrogen fixation both in symbiotic conditions and in the free-living state using a pfixk-lacz fusion the fixlj products were shown to control the expression of fixk using a pnifa-lacz fusion the fixk product was shown to regulate positively the transcription of nifa in bacteria grown in the free-living state in addition a double ntrc-fixl mutant was constructed and was shown to be completely devoid of nitrogenase activity a model of regulation based on these data is presented and might explain the unusual ability of a caulinodans to fix nitrogen both under symbiotic conditions and in the free-living state
E,a 56 kb dna fragment from the fungus phycomyces blakesleeanus has been cloned and sequenced the fragment contains a gene that probably codes for the enzyme acetyl-coenzyme a synthetase faca the amino acid sequence deduced for the p blakesleeanus protein is highly homologous to those of acetyl-coa-synthetases from other organisms when placed under the control of a constitutive promoter from aspergillus nidulans the cloned gene complemented a faca- mutation of this organism in p blakesleeanus the expression of faca is induced by acetate
B,pseudomonas putida is a metabolically versatile saprophytic soil bacterium that has been certified as a biosafety host for the cloning of foreign genes the bacterium also has considerable potential for biotechnological applications sequence analysis of the 618 mb genome of strain kt2440 reveals diverse transport and metabolic systems although there is a high level of genome conservation with the pathogenic pseudomonad pseudomonas aeruginosa 85 of the predicted coding regions are shared key virulence factors including exotoxin a and type iii secretion systems are absent analysis of the genome gives insight into the non-pathogenic nature of p putida and points to potential new applications in agriculture biocatalysis bioremediation and bioplastic production
A,the complete 166-megabase pair genome sequence of an autotrophic archaeon methanococcus jannaschii and its 58- and 16-kilobase pair extrachromosomal elements have been determined by whole-genome random sequencing a total of 1738 predicted protein-coding genes were identified however only a minority of these 38 percent could be assigned a putative cellular role with high confidence although the majority of genes related to energy production cell division and metabolism in m jannaschii are most similar to those found in bacteria most of the genes involved in transcription translation and replication in m jannaschii are more similar to those found in eukaryotes
B,helicobacter pylori strain 26695 has a circular genome of 1667867 base pairs and 1590 predicted coding sequences sequence analysis indicates that h pylori has well-developed systems for motility for scavenging iron and for dna restriction and modification many putative adhesins lipoproteins and other outer membrane proteins were identified underscoring the potential complexity of host-pathogen interaction based on the large number of sequence-related genes encoding outer membrane proteins and the presence of homopolymeric tracts and dinucleotide repeats in coding sequences h pylori like several other mucosal pathogens probably uses recombination and slipped-strand mispairing within repeats as mechanisms for antigenic variation and adaptive evolution consistent with its restricted niche h pylori has a few regulatory networks and a limited metabolic repertoire and biosynthetic capacity its survival in acid conditions depends in part on its ability to establish a positive inside-membrane potential in low ph
B,helicobacter hepaticus causes chronic hepatitis and liver cancer in mice it is the prototype enterohepatic helicobacter species and a close relative of helicobacter pylori also a recognized carcinogen here we report the complete genome sequence of h hepaticus atcc51449 h hepaticus has a circular chromosome of 1799146 base pairs predicted to encode 1875 proteins a total of 938 953 and 821 proteins have orthologs in h pylori campylobacter jejuni and both pathogens respectively h hepaticus lacks orthologs of most known h pylori virulence factors including adhesins the vaca cytotoxin and almost all cag pathogenicity island proteins but has orthologs of the c jejuni adhesin peb1 and the cytolethal distending toxin cdt the genome contains a 71-kb genomic island hhgi1 and several genomic islets whose gc content differs from the rest of the genome hhgi1 encodes three basic components of a type iv secretion system and other virulence protein homologs suggesting a role of hhgi1 in pathogenicity the genomic variability of h hepaticus was assessed by comparing the genomes of 12 h hepaticus strains with the sequenced genome by microarray hybridization although five strains including all those known to have caused liver disease were indistinguishable from atcc51449 other strains lacked between 85 and 229 genes including large parts of hhgi1 demonstrating extensive variation of genome content within the species
B,the structural gene encoding chondroitin abc lyase from proteus vulgaris was cloned and sequenced this gene consists of a single open reading frame of 3063 bp including a sequence 72 bp for a possible secretory protein leader peptide preceded by a shine-dalgarno ribosomal binding site promoter-like and rho-independent terminator sequences were detected upstream and downstream of the open reading frame respectively the gc content of the coding region was 386 the transcription startpoint was located 41-bp upstream of the initiation codon atg chondroitin abc lyase is composed of 997 amino acids and has a relative molecular mass of 112635 when the 52-kb fragment containing the 12-kb upstream from the gene was inserted into pstv29 and cloned in escherichia coli chondroitin abc lyase was induced in the medium containing chondroitin-6-sulfate as the carbon source on the other hand when a 42-kb fragment containing only 02 kb upstream was inserted into pstv29pchs delta 6 and pchs delta 6 was introduced into e coli the enzyme was constitutively produced even in medium containing glucose as the carbon source by immunoblot analysis the polypeptide synthesized by e coli cells carrying pchs delta 6 appeared to be the same as that of the purified chondroitin abc lyase from p vulgaris
E,background in eukaryotes chromosomal dna is licensed to be replicated through the sequential loading of the origin recognition complex cdc6 and mini-chromosome maintenance protein complex mcm onto chromatin however how the replication machinery is assembled onto the licensed chromatin during initiation of replication is poorly understood results using xenopus egg extracts we have investigated the role of cdc45 in the loading of various replication proteins onto chromatin at the onset of s phase and found that cdc45 which required mcm for its loading was essential for the sequential loading of replication protein a rpa dna polymerase alpha and proliferating cell nuclear antigen pcna onto chromatin the assembly of dna polymerase epsilon onto chromatin required cdc45 but did not require dna polymerase alpha analysis of nuclease-digested chromatin fractions shows that cdc45 formed a stable complex with either mcm or dna polymerase alpha on chromatin conclusions these results demonstrate a central role for cdc45 in activation of the licensed chromatin to form replication complexes at the onset of s phase and suggest that cdc45 has a dual role in the initiation of dna replication the unwinding of dna and the recruiting of dna polymerases onto dna
B,staphylococcus epidermidis strains are diverse in their pathogenicity some are invasive and cause serious nosocomial infections whereas others are non-pathogenic commensal organisms to analyse the implications of different virulence factors in staphylococcus epidermidis infections the complete genome of staphylococcus epidermidis strain atcc 12228 a non-biofilm forming non-infection associated strain used for detection of residual antibiotics in food products was sequenced this strain showed low virulence by mouse and rat experimental infections the genome consists of a single 2499 279 bp chromosome and six plasmids the chromosomal g  c content is 321 and 2419 protein coding sequences cds are predicted among which 230 are putative novel genes compared to the virulence factors in staphylococcus aureus aside from delta-haemolysin and beta-haemolysin other toxin genes were not found in contrast the majority of adhesin genes are intact in atcc 12228 most strikingly the ica operon coding for the enzymes synthesizing interbacterial cellular polysaccharide is missing in atcc 12228 and rearrangements of adjacent genes are shown no mec genes is256 is257 were found in atcc 12228 it is suggested that the absence of the ica operon is a genetic marker in commensal staphylococcus epidermidis strains which are less likely to become invasive
E,cytidine diphosphate cdp-diacylglycerol synthase cytidine triphosphatephosphatidate cytihyltransferase ec 27741 catalyzes the formation of cdp-diacylglycerol which is the precursor of phosphatidylinositol phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin we report the first cloning to our knowledge of two plant cdnas stcds1 and atcds1 coding for cdp-diacylglycerol synthase from potato solanum tuberosum and arabidopsis thaliana respectively the two proteins belong to the eukaryotic type of cdp-diacylglycerol synthase and contain eight predicted transmembrane-spanning domains we analyzed gene expression in shoot and root tissues of potato plants and demonstrated enzyme activity by expression of n-terminally truncated recombinant stcds1 in escherichia coli
B,the 2160837-base pair genome sequence of an isolate of streptococcus pneumoniae a gram-positive pathogen that causes pneumonia bacteremia meningitis and otitis media contains 2236 predicted coding regions of these 1440 64 were assigned a biological role approximately 5 of the genome is composed of insertion sequences that may contribute to genome rearrangements through uptake of foreign dna extracellular enzyme systems for the metabolism of polysaccharides and hexosamines provide a substantial source of carbon and nitrogen for s pneumoniae and also damage host tissues and facilitate colonization a motif identified within the signal peptide of proteins is potentially involved in targeting these proteins to the cell surface of low-guaninecytosine gc gram-positive species several surface-exposed proteins that may serve as potential vaccine candidates were identified comparative genome hybridization with dna arrays revealed strain differences in s pneumoniae that could contribute to differences in virulence and antigenicity
E,genes that are highly expressed on glucose-containing media were isolated from the filamentous fungus trichoderma reesei a cdna bank was prepared from glucose-grown fungus the bank was screened with the same cdna as a probe and clones giving the strongest signal were isolated this resulted in the isolation of previously uncharacterized genes five of the genes representing the most abundant transcripts corresponded to 1-3 of the total mrna population and were clearly more highly expressed than the phosphoglycerate kinase-encoding gene pgk1 of t reesei based on sequence homology one of the genes was identified as tef1 encoding translation elongation factor 1 alpha tef the t reesei tef is most related to the mucor racemosus tef3 showing an overall amino acid similarity of 85 interestingly an exon of only 2 bp seems to be present in t reesei tef1 comprising the first 2 bp of the gly15 codon
E,calpain a calcium-dependent intracellular protease was identified in drosophila melanogaster drosophila calpain has an amino acid sequence highly homologous to those of mammalian calpains and exhibits a distinct domain structure consisting of cysteine protease and calcium-binding domains specific antibodies raised against a recombinant calpain fragment were used to identify the localization of calpain in developing drosophila embryos calpain was first detected near the anterior pole and in posterior region of the embryo just after fertilization the anterior calpain disappeared during the cleavage cycles on the other hand the posterior calpain moved to the posterior pole when polar buds were formed and condensed just below the pole cells at cleavage cycles 8 and 9 when nuclei reached the egg surface calpain was localized between the nuclei at the surface beneath the precleavage furrows co-staining experiments with anti-actin antibody revealed that calpain condenses specifically at the edge of and between actin caps that underlie the plasma membrane immediately above each nucleus these results indicate that calpain is involved in the dynamic changes in the embryonic cytoskeleton especially actin-related structures during early embryogenesis prior to cellularization
B,the complete genome sequence of the radiation-resistant bacterium deinococcus radiodurans r1 is composed of two chromosomes 2648638 and 412348 base pairs a megaplasmid 177466 base pairs and a small plasmid 45704 base pairs yielding a total genome of 3284 156 base pairs multiple components distributed on the chromosomes and megaplasmid that contribute to the ability of d radiodurans to survive under conditions of starvation oxidative stress and high amounts of dna damage were identified deinococcus radiodurans represents an organism in which all systems for dna repair dna damage export desiccation and starvation recovery and genetic redundancy are present in one cell
B,the rhizobium leguminosarum bv trifolii exob gene has been isolated by heterologous complementation of an exob mutant of r meliloti we have cloned a chromosomal dna fragment from the r leguminosarum bv trifolii genome that contains an open reading frame of 981 bp showing 80 identity at the amino acid level to the udp-glucose 4-epimerase of r meliloti this enzyme produces udp-galactose the donor of galactosyl residues for the lipid-linked oligosaccharide repeat units of various heteropolysaccharides of rhizobia an r leguminosarum bv trifolii exob disruption mutant differed from the wild type in the structure of both the acidic exopolysaccharide and the lipopolysaccharide the acidic exopolysaccharide made by our wild-type strain is similar to the type 2 exopolysaccharide made by other r leguminosarum bv trifolii wild types the exopolysaccharide made by the exob mutant lacked the galactose residue and the substitutions attached to it the exob mutant induced the development of abnormal root nodules and was almost completely unable to invade plant cells our results stress the importance of exob in the rhizobium-plant interaction
B,the 1852442-bp sequence of an m1 strain of streptococcus pyogenes a gram-positive pathogen has been determined and contains 1752 predicted protein-encoding genes approximately one-third of these genes have no identifiable function with the remainder falling into previously characterized categories of known microbial function consistent with the observation that s pyogenes is responsible for a wider variety of human disease than any other bacterial species more than 40 putative virulence-associated genes have been identified additional genes have been identified that encode proteins likely associated with microbial molecular mimicry of host characteristics and involved in rheumatic fever or acute glomerulonephritis the complete or partial sequence of four different bacteriophage genomes is also present with each containing genes for one or more previously undiscovered superantigen-like proteins these prophage-associated genes encode at least six potential virulence factors emphasizing the importance of bacteriophages in horizontal gene transfer and a possible mechanism for generating new strains with increased pathogenic potential
E,neuronal degeneration has been shown to be involved in various neurological disorders growthtrophic factors and their receptors are known to be important for the regeneration and survival of neurons we report here the molecular cloning of a receptor-like protein tyrosine kinase bsk for brain specific kinase bsk is highly related to the ephelk receptor-like kinase family members northern blot analysis shows that it is expressed specifically in the brain with no expression detected in adult heart spleen lung liver skeletal muscle and kidney in situ hybridization analysis of adult mouse brain sections indicates that bsk is expressed at high levels in the hippocampus tenia tecta indusium griseum and the piriform cortex major components of the limbic system that are important for learning and memory in addition elevated levels of expression are found in other areas of the limbic system such as the amygdala medial septum and nucleus of the diagonal band and in the olfactory bulb which has close connections to the limbic system the highest level of expression is found in the ca3 region of the hippocampus and the pyramidal cell layer of the piriform cortex in 165 day mouse embryos bsk is expressed predominantly in the primordial cortex of the telencephalon an antibody against a c-terminal peptide of bsk recognized a 105 kd protein in the 165 day embryonic head extract our analysis shows that bsk is a growth factor receptor-like protein tyrosine kinase and that its greatest expression in the adult brain is associated with components of the limbic system
E,the fly drosophila melanogaster is one of the most intensively studied organisms in biology and serves as a model system for the investigation of many developmental and cellular processes common to higher eukaryotes including humans we have determined the nucleotide sequence of nearly all of the approximately 120-megabase euchromatic portion of the drosophila genome using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy supported by extensive clone-based sequence and a high-quality bacterial artificial chromosome physical map efforts are under way to close the remaining gaps however the sequence is of sufficient accuracy and contiguity to be declared substantially complete and to support an initial analysis of genome structure and preliminary gene annotation and interpretation the genome encodes approximately 13600 genes somewhat fewer than the smaller caenorhabditis elegans genome but with comparable functional diversity
A,the complete sequence of the genome of an aerobic hyper-thermophilic crenarchaeon aeropyrum pernix k1 which optimally grows at 95 degrees c has been determined by the whole genome shotgun method with some modifications the entire length of the genome was 1669695 bp the authenticity of the entire sequence was supported by restriction analysis of long pcr products which were directly amplified from the genomic dna as the potential protein-coding regions a total of 2694 open reading frames orfs were assigned by similarity search against public databases 633 235 of the orfs were related to genes with putative function and 523 194 to the sequences registered but with unknown function all the genes in the tca cycle except for that of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase were included and instead of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase gene the genes coding for the two subunits of 2-oxoacidferredoxin oxidoreductase were identified the remaining 1538 orfs 571 did not show any significant similarity to the sequences in the databases sequence comparison among the assigned orfs suggested that a considerable member of orfs were generated by sequence duplication the rna genes identified were a single 16s-23s rrna operon two 5s rrna genes and 47 trna genes including 14 genes with intron structures all the assigned orfs and rna coding regions occupied 8912 of the whole genome the data presented in this paper are available on the internet homepage httpwwwmildnitegojp
E,an expression profile of active genes in a human neuroblastoma cell line chp134 was obtained by collecting 1222 partial sequences from a 3'-directed cdna library representing a non-biased mrna population by comparing this expression profile with the compiled profiles of multiple tissues several novel gene transcripts that appeared only in the profile of the neuroblastoma cell line were identified further analyses by northern blotting revealed two specific cdna clones that are expressed in most of the human neuroblastomas examined and three that are in some of the human neuroblastoma cell lines as well as in the adult human brain full-size cdnas were cloned using these five partial cdna sequences as probes and sequenced a database search revealed that they are all novel and unique sequences one sharing some amino acid sequence similarities with a cytoskeletal protein two clones likely to be transcriptional factors a clone that has characteristic potassium channel properties and a clone that is non-homologous to any one of the known proteins thus we argue that the collection of 3'-directed cdna sequences in combination with the compiled expression profiles of active genes in multiple tissues is a powerful tool for discovering novel genes that are specifically expressed in a given cell or tissue in this case neuroblastomas andor nerve tissue
B,the genes for two novel members designated 85a and 85c of the mycobacterium leprae antigen 85 complex family of proteins and the gene for the closely related m leprae mpt51 protein were isolated the complete dna sequence of the m leprae 85c gene and partial sequences of the 85a and mpt51 genes are presented as in m tuberculosis the m leprae 85a 85c and previously identified 85b component genes are not closely linked on the genome however the mpt51 genes of both species localize close to the respective 85a component genes like the 85b component the m leprae 85a-mpt51 and 85c antigens are recognized by t cells from healthy contacts and leprosy patients
E,e2f has been implicated in growth control because of its association with the retinoblastoma protein and the presence of e2f binding sites in the promoters of several growth-regulated genes proteins that bind to an e2f site have been cloned from human and mouse cells however these two proteins human e2f1 and mouse dp-1 are quite different in sequence we have now cloned a mouse cdna encoding a protein 86 identical to the human e2f1 protein the mouse e2f1 cdna encodes a 430-amino-acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 46322 and detects mrnas of 27 and 22 kb using primers complementary to sequences in the mouse e2f1 3' untranslated region we mapped the mouse e2f1 gene to chromosome 2 near the agouti and c-src loci to understand the role of the different e2f family members in the growth of mouse nih 3t3 cells we examined the levels of e2f1 and dp-1 mrnas in different stages of the cell cycle since the levels of e2f1 but not dp-1 mrna correlated with changes in transcription from the dhfr promoter we examined whether e2f1 could activate various growth-regulated promoters we found that e2f1 could activate some dhfr thymidine kinase and dna polymerase alpha but not all thymidylate synthase cad and c-myc of these promoters on the basis of changes in levels of e2f1 and its ability to transactivate growth-regulated promoters we propose that e2f1 may mediate growth factor-initiated signal transduction
E,we have identified a novel serinethreonine kinase designated zip kinase which mediates apoptosis zip kinase contains a leucine zipper structure at its c terminus in addition to a kinase domain at its n terminus zip kinase physically binds to atf4 a member of the activating transcription factorcyclic amp-responsive element-binding protein atfcreb family through interaction between their leucine zippers the leucine zipper domain is necessary for the homodimerization of zip kinase as well as for the activation of kinase immunostaining study showed that zip kinase localizes in the nuclei overexpression of intact zip kinase but not catalytically inactive kinase mutants led to the morphological changes of apoptosis in nih 3t3 cells suggesting that the cell death-inducing activity of zip kinase depends on its intrinsic kinase activity interestingly the catalytic domain of zip kinase is closely related to that of death-associated protein kinase dap kinase which is a mediator of apoptosis induced by gamma interferon therefore both zip and dap kinases represent a novel kinase family which mediates apoptosis through their catalytic activities
B,background vibrio parahaemolyticus a gram-negative marine bacterium is a worldwide cause of food-borne gastroenteritis v parahaemolyticus strains of a few specific serotypes probably derived from a common clonal ancestor have lately caused a pandemic of gastroenteritis the organism is phylogenetically close to v cholerae the causative agent of cholera methods the whole genome sequence of a clinical v parahaemolyticus strain rimd2210633 was established by shotgun sequencing the coding sequences were identified by use of gambler and glimmer programs comparative analysis with the v cholerae genome was undertaken with mummer findings the genome consisted of two circular chromosomes of 3288558 bp and 1877212 bp it contained 4832 genes comparison of the v parahaemolyticus genome with that of v cholerae showed many rearrangements within and between the two chromosomes genes for the type iii secretion system ttss were identified in the genome of v parahaemolyticus v cholerae does not have these genes interpretation the ttss is a central virulence factor of diarrhoea-causing bacteria such as shigella salmonella and enteropathogenic escherichia coli which cause gastroenteritis by invading or intimately interacting with intestinal epithelial cells our results suggest that v parahaemolyticus and v cholerae use distinct mechanisms to establish infection this finding explains clinical features of v parahaemolyticus infections which commonly include inflammatory diarrhoea and in some cases systemic manifestations such as septicaemia distinct from those of v cholerae infections which are generally associated with non-inflammatory diarrhoea
B,background staphylococcus aureus is one of the major causes of community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections it produces numerous toxins including superantigens that cause unique disease entities such as toxic-shock syndrome and staphylococcal scarlet fever and has acquired resistance to practically all antibiotics whole genome analysis is a necessary step towards future development of countermeasures against this organism methods whole genome sequences of two related s aureus strains n315 and mu50 were determined by shot-gun random sequencing n315 is a meticillin-resistant s aureus mrsa strain isolated in 1982 and mu50 is an mrsa strain with vancomycin resistance isolated in 1997 the open reading frames were identified by use of gambler and glimmer programs and annotation of each was done with a blast homology search motif analysis and protein localisation prediction findings the staphylococcus genome was composed of a complex mixture of genes many of which seem to have been acquired by lateral gene transfer most of the antibiotic resistance genes were carried either by plasmids or by mobile genetic elements including a unique resistance island three classes of new pathogenicity islands were identified in the genome a toxic-shock-syndrome toxin island family exotoxin islands and enterotoxin islands in the latter two pathogenicity islands clusters of exotoxin and enterotoxin genes were found closely linked with other gene clusters encoding putative pathogenic factors the analysis also identified 70 candidates for new virulence factors interpretation the remarkable ability of s aureus to acquire useful genes from various organisms was revealed through the observation of genome complexity and evidence of lateral gene transfer repeated duplication of genes encoding superantigens explains why s aureus is capable of infecting humans of diverse genetic backgrounds eliciting severe immune reactions investigation of many newly identified gene products including the 70 putative virulence factors will greatly improve our understanding of the biology of staphylococci and the processes of infectious diseases caused by s aureus
E,using degenerate polymerase chain reaction we isolated a cdna encoding a novel 493-amino acid protein from human and mouse adult heart cdnas and have designated it angiopoietin-related protein-2 arp2 the nh2-terminal and cooh-terminal portions of arp2 contain the characteristic coiled-coil domain and fibrinogen-like domain that are conserved in angiopoietins arp2 has two consensus glycosylation sites and a highly hydrophobic region at the nh2 terminus that is typical of a secretory signal sequence recombinant arp2 expressed in cos cells is secreted and glycosylated in human adult tissues arp2 mrna is most abundant in heart small intestine spleen and stomach in rat embryos arp2 mrna is most abundant in the blood vessels and skeletal muscles endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells also contain arp2 mrna recombinant arp2 protein induces sprouting in vascular endothelial cells but does not bind to the tie1 or tie2 receptor these results suggest that arp2 may exert a function on endothelial cells through autocrine or paracrine action
E,mutations in the yeast gene ard1 lead to inability to respond to alpha-factor inability to enter stationary phase and inability to sporulate suggesting an important role for the ard1 gene product in controlling the switch between the mitotic cell cycle and alternative cell fates mata ard1 cells seem to be defective in the expression of all a-specific functions whereas mat alpha ard1 cells respond normally to a-factor we propose that ard1 is required for the expression of genes involved in a-mating functions stationary phase and sporulation the ard1 gene has been cloned and sequenced there is weak homology between the c terminus of the ard1 protein the c-terminal region of mat alpha 2 and the homeo box
B,bacillus anthracis is an endospore-forming bacterium that causes inhalational anthrax key virulence genes are found on plasmids extra-chromosomal circular double-stranded dna molecules pxo1 ref 2 and pxo2 ref 3 to identify additional genes that might contribute to virulence we analysed the complete sequence of the chromosome of b anthracis ames about 523 megabases we found several chromosomally encoded proteins that may contribute to pathogenicity--including haemolysins phospholipases and iron acquisition functions--and identified numerous surface proteins that might be important targets for vaccines and drugs almost all these putative chromosomal virulence and surface proteins have homologues in bacillus cereus highlighting the similarity of b anthracis to near-neighbours that are not associated with anthrax by performing a comparative genome hybridization of 19 b cereus and bacillus thuringiensis strains against a b anthracis dna microarray we confirmed the general similarity of chromosomal genes among this group of close relatives however we found that the gene sequences of pxo1 and pxo2 were more variable between strains suggesting plasmid mobility in the group the complete sequence of b anthracis is a step towards a better understanding of anthrax pathogenesis
B,lactococcus lactis is a nonpathogenic at-rich gram-positive bacterium closely related to the genus streptococcus and is the most commonly used cheese starter it is also the best-characterized lactic acid bacterium we sequenced the genome of the laboratory strain il1403 using a novel two-step strategy that comprises diagnostic sequencing of the entire genome and a shotgun polishing step the genome contains 2365589 base pairs and encodes 2310 proteins including 293 protein-coding genes belonging to six prophages and 43 insertion sequence is elements nonrandom distribution of is elements indicates that the chromosome of the sequenced strain may be a product of recent recombination between two closely related genomes a complete set of late competence genes is present indicating the ability of l lactis to undergo dna transformation genomic sequence revealed new possibilities for fermentation pathways and for aerobic respiration it also indicated a horizontal transfer of genetic information from lactococcus to gram-negative enteric bacteria of salmonella-escherichia group
E,the cot1 gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae has been isolated as a dosage-dependent suppressor of cobalt toxicity overexpression of the cot1 gene confers increased tolerance to cobalt and rhodium ions but not other divalent cations strains containing null alleles of cot1 are viable yet more sensitive to cobalt than are wild-type strains transcription of cot1 responds minimally to the extracellular cobalt concentration addition of cobalt ions to growth media results in a twofold increase in cot1 mrna abundance the gene encodes a 48-kda protein which is found in mitochondrial membrane fractions of cells the protein contains six possible membrane-spanning domains and several potential metal-binding amino acid residues the cot1 protein shares 60 identity with the zrc1 gene product which confers resistance to zinc and cadmium ions cobalt transport studies indicate that the cot1 product is involved in the uptake of cobalt ions yet is not solely responsible for it the increased tolerance of strains containing multiple copies of the cot1 gene is probably due to increased compartmentalization or sequestration of the ion within mitochondria
B,we present the complete genome sequence of uropathogenic escherichia coli strain cft073 a three-way genome comparison of the cft073 enterohemorrhagic e coli edl933 and laboratory strain mg1655 reveals that amazingly only 392 of their combined nonredundant set of proteins actually are common to all three strains the pathogen genomes are as different from each other as each pathogen is from the benign strain the difference in disease potential between o157h7 and cft073 is reflected in the absence of genes for type iii secretion system or phage- and plasmid-encoded toxins found in some classes of diarrheagenic e coli the cft073 genome is particularly rich in genes that encode potential fimbrial adhesins autotransporters iron-sequestration systems and phase-switch recombinases striking differences exist between the large pathogenicity islands of cft073 and two other well-studied uropathogenic e coli strains j96 and 536 comparisons indicate that extraintestinal pathogenic e coli arose independently from multiple clonal lineages the different e coli pathotypes have maintained a remarkable synteny of common vertically evolved genes whereas many islands interrupting this common backbone have been acquired by different horizontal transfer events in each strain
E,humans possess five classes of alcohol dehydrogenase adh including forms able to oxidize ethanol or formaldehyde as part of a defense mechanism as well as forms acting as retinol dehydrogenases in the synthesis of the regulatory ligand retinoic acid however the mouse has previously been shown to possess only three forms of adh hybridization analysis of mouse genomic dna using cdna probes specific for each of the five classes of human adh has now indicated that mouse dna cross-hybridizes to only classes i iii and iv with human class ii or class v adh cdna probes hybridization to mouse genomic dna was very weak or undetectable suggesting either a lack of these genes in the mouse or a high degree of mutational divergence relative to the human genes cdnas for murine adh classes i and iii have previously been cloned and we now report the cloning of a full-length mouse class iv adh cdna in northern blot analyses mouse class iv adh mrna was abundant in the stomach eye skin and ovary thus correlating with the expression pattern for the mouse adh-3 gene previously determined by enzyme analysis in situ hybridization studies on mouse stomach indicated that class iv adh transcripts were abundant in the mucosal epithelium but absent from the muscular layer comparison of the expression patterns for all three mouse adh genes indicated that class iii was expressed ubiquitously whereas classes i and iv were differentially expressed in an overlapping set of tissues that all contain a large component of epithelial cells this expression pattern is consistent with the ability of classes i and iv to oxidize retinol for the synthesis of retinoic acid known to regulate epithelial cell differentiation the results presented here indicate that the mouse has a simpler adh gene family than the human but has conserved class iv adh previously shown to be a very active retinol dehydrogenase in humans
A,the complete 1751377-bp sequence of the genome of the thermophilic archaeon methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum deltah has been determined by a whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach a total of 1855 open reading frames orfs have been identified that appear to encode polypeptides 844 46 of which have been assigned putative functions based on their similarities to database sequences with assigned functions a total of 514 28 of the orf-encoded polypeptides are related to sequences with unknown functions and 496 27 have little or no homology to sequences in public databases comparisons with eucarya- bacteria- and archaea-specific databases reveal that 1013 of the putative gene products 54 are most similar to polypeptide sequences described previously for other organisms in the domain archaea comparisons with the methanococcus jannaschii genome data underline the extensive divergence that has occurred between these two methanogens only 352 19 of m thermoautotrophicum orfs encode sequences that are 50 identical to m jannaschii polypeptides and there is little conservation in the relative locations of orthologous genes when the m thermoautotrophicum orfs are compared to sequences from only the eucaryal and bacterial domains 786 42 are more similar to bacterial sequences and 241 13 are more similar to eucaryal sequences the bacterial domain-like gene products include the majority of those predicted to be involved in cofactor and small molecule biosyntheses intermediary metabolism transport nitrogen fixation regulatory functions and interactions with the environment most proteins predicted to be involved in dna metabolism transcription and translation are more similar to eucaryal sequences gene structure and organization have features that are typical of the bacteria including genes that encode polypeptides closely related to eucaryal proteins there are 24 polypeptides that could form two-component sensor kinase-response regulator systems and homologs of the bacterial hsp70-response proteins dnak and dnaj which are notably absent in m jannaschii dna replication initiation and chromosome packaging in m thermoautotrophicum are predicted to have eucaryal features based on the presence of two cdc6 homologs and three histones however the presence of an ftsz gene indicates a bacterial type of cell division initiation the dna polymerases include an x-family repair type and an unusual archaeal b type formed by two separate polypeptides the dna-dependent rna polymerase rnap subunits a' a b' b and h are encoded in a typical archaeal rnap operon although a second a' subunit-encoding gene is present at a remote location there are two rrna operons and 39 trna genes are dispersed around the genome although most of these occur in clusters three of the trna genes have introns including the trnapro ggg gene which contains a second intron at an unprecedented location there is no selenocysteinyl-trna gene nor evidence for classically organized is elements prophages or plasmids the genome contains one intein and two extended repeats 36 and 86 kb that are members of a family with 18 representatives in the m jannaschii genome
E,the spindle checkpoint ensures proper chromosome segregation by delaying anaphase until all chromosomes are correctly attached to the mitotic spindle we investigated the role of the fission yeast bub1 gene in spindle checkpoint function and in unperturbed mitoses we find that bub1 is essential for the fission yeast spindle checkpoint response to spindle damage and to defects in centromere function activation of the checkpoint results in the recruitment of bub1 to centromeres and a delay in the completion of mitosis we show that bub1 also has a crucial role in normal unperturbed mitoses loss of bub1 function causes chromosomes to lag on the anaphase spindle and an increased frequency of chromosome loss such genomic instability is even more dramatic in deltabub1 diploids leading to massive chromosome missegregation events and loss of the diploid state demonstrating that bub1 function is essential to maintain correct ploidy through mitosis as in larger eukaryotes bub1 is recruited to kinetochores during the early stages of mitosis however unlike its vertebrate counterpart a pool of bub1 remains centromere-associated at metaphase and even until telophase we discuss the possibility of a role for the bub1 kinase after the metaphase-anaphase transition
E,the national institutes of health mammalian gene collection mgc program is a multiinstitutional effort to identify and sequence a cdna clone containing a complete orf for each human and mouse gene ests were generated from libraries enriched for full-length cdnas and analyzed to identify candidate full-orf clones which then were sequenced to high accuracy the mgc has currently sequenced and verified the full orf for a nonredundant set of 9000 human and 6000 mouse genes candidate full-orf clones for an additional 7800 human and 3500 mouse genes also have been identified all mgc sequences and clones are available without restriction through public databases and clone distribution networks see httpmgcncinihgov
B,the complete genome sequence of enterococcus faecalis v583 a vancomycin-resistant clinical isolate revealed that more than a quarter of the genome consists of probable mobile or foreign dna one of the predicted mobile elements is a previously unknown vanb vancomycin-resistance conjugative transposon three plasmids were identified including two pheromone-sensing conjugative plasmids one encoding a previously undescribed pheromone inhibitor the apparent propensity for the incorporation of mobile elements probably contributed to the rapid acquisition and dissemination of drug resistance in the enterococci
B,sur0b20 is a mutation that suppresses the effects of spo0b delta b or spo0f221 mutations in bacillus subtilis sur0b20 is an allele of the spo0a gene glu-14 to val-14 conversion and restores the sporulation of spo0b or spo0f mutants to the wild-type level here we report the isolation of suppressor mutations of sur0b20 ssb one of these mutations ssb-12 severely impairs the suppressor activity of sur0b20 a 25-kbp mboi fragment which complements the ssb-12 mutation was cloned by the prophage transformation method using phi cm as a vector nucleotide sequencing of the fragment revealed two open reading frames orf1 and orf2 gene disruption and complementation experiments showed that orf2 is the ssb gene ssb was shown to encode a protein with a molecular weight of 48846 428 amino acid residues showing strong similarity to transmitter kinases especially kina of two-component regulatory systems therefore ssb was renamed kinc deletion of kinc had no observable effect on sporulation kinc transcription was induced at the onset of sporulation probably from a sigma a-dependent promoter and its expression was shut off at t3 dnase i protection experiments showed that the spo0a protein binds to two adjoining sites in the kinc promoter region with different affinities these results suggest that kinc expression might be regulated by spo0a
E,with a cdna probe encoding rat muscle type carnitine palmitoyltransferase i cpti we isolated cdna and genomic clones encoding the human homologue and deduced the primary structure of human muscle type cpti by northern analysis we confirmed the dominant expression of this isoform in heart and skeletal muscle
B,in this paper we describe the nucleotide sequence of a 34 kbp region of the mycobacterium leprae genome this region contains an open reading frame of 1290 bp with a coding capacity for a protein of 46179 da designated the 38l protein using antibodies against part of the 38l protein we were able to demonstrate that the 38l protein is present in the membrane protein fraction of m leprae the 38l protein showed significant matches with a number of integral membrane proteins involved in the transport of small molecules through the cellular membrane among these are a human and a murine protein involved in melanin biosynthesis the 38l protein might play a role in the hypopigmentation observed in leprosy patients
E,the nucleotide sequence of the 948061 base pairs of chromosome xvi has been determined completing the sequence of the yeast genome chromosome xvi was the last yeast chromosome identified and some of the genes mapped early to it such as gal4 pep4 and rad1 ref 2 have played important roles in the development of yeast biology the architecture of this final chromosome seems to be typical of the large yeast chromosomes and shows large duplications with other yeast chromosomes chromosome xvi contains 487 potential protein-encoding genes 17 trna genes and two small nuclear rna genes 27 of the genes have significant similarities to human gene products and 48 are new and of unknown biological function systematic efforts to explore gene function have begun
E,we have determined the nucleotide sequence of two transcription units of the as-c and shown that their potential protein coding regions share two principal domains of homology both domains are conserved within the myc protein family and one of them is highly homologous with the consensus for protein tyrosine kinase substrates we show in addition that at least one of these domains is shared with other transcription units within the as-c some of which were not previously known we suggest that the as-c encodes several homologous polypeptides which represent a subset of a larger gene family we propose that each member of the family functions at an equivalent stage of a unique morphogenetic operation involving the segregation of individual neural lineages from the epidermal anlage
B,here we determine the complete genomic sequence of the gram negative gamma-proteobacterium vibrio cholerae el tor n16961 to be 4033460 base pairs bp the genome consists of two circular chromosomes of 2961146 bp and 1072314 bp that together encode 3885 open reading frames the vast majority of recognizable genes for essential cell functions such as dna replication transcription translation and cell-wall biosynthesis and pathogenicity for example toxins surface antigens and adhesins are located on the large chromosome in contrast the small chromosome contains a larger fraction 59 of hypothetical genes compared with the large chromosome 42 and also contains many more genes that appear to have origins other than the gamma-proteobacteria the small chromosome also carries a gene capture system the integron island and host 'addiction' genes that are typically found on plasmids thus the small chromosome may have originally been a megaplasmid that was captured by an ancestral vibrio species the v cholerae genomic sequence provides a starting point for understanding how a free-living environmental organism emerged to become a significant human bacterial pathogen
B,we have shown that the open reading frame ybbi in the genomic sequence of escherichia coli k-12 encodes the regulator of expression of the copper-exporting atpase copa in vivo studies showed that ybbi designated cuer for copper export regulator gene was required for copper tolerance during growth that disruption of cuer caused loss of copa expression and that copa gene expression was regulated by cuer and by copper or silver ions expression of a lacz reporter gene under the control of the copa promoter was approximately proportional to the concentration of cupric ions in the medium but increased more rapidly in response to silver ion concentrations the start of the copa transcript was located by primer extension mapping and dnase i protection assays showed that the cuer protein binds in vitro to a dyad symmetrical sequence within a 19 bp spacer sequence in the copa promoter cuer binding occurs in vitro in both the presence and the absence of rna polymerase with or without copper ions present but in the presence of cuer rna polymerase and copper ions permanganate-sensitive transcription complexes were formed cuer is predicted to have an n-terminal helix-turn-helix sequence and shows similarity to merr family regulators
B,the symbiotic nitrogen-fixing soil bacterium sinorhizobium meliloti contains three replicons psyma psymb and the chromosome we report here the complete 1354226-nt sequence of psyma in addition to a large fraction of the genes known to be specifically involved in symbiosis psyma contains genes likely to be involved in nitrogen and carbon metabolism transport stress and resistance responses and other functions that give s meliloti an advantage in its specialized niche
B,leprosy a chronic human neurological disease results from infection with the obligate intracellular pathogen mycobacterium leprae a close relative of the tubercle bacillus mycobacterium leprae has the longest doubling time of all known bacteria and has thwarted every effort at culture in the laboratory comparing the 327-megabase mb genome sequence of an armadillo-derived indian isolate of the leprosy bacillus with that of mycobacterium tuberculosis 441 mb provides clear explanations for these properties and reveals an extreme case of reductive evolution less than half of the genome contains functional genes but pseudogenes with intact counterparts in m tuberculosis abound genome downsizing and the current mosaic arrangement appear to have resulted from extensive recombination events between dispersed repetitive sequences gene deletion and decay have eliminated many important metabolic activities including siderophore production part of the oxidative and most of the microaerophilic and anaerobic respiratory chains and numerous catabolic systems and their regulatory circuits
B,the nucleotide sequence of bkdb the structural gene for e2b the transacylase component of branched-chain-oxoacid dehydrogenase of pseudomonas putida has been determined and translated into its amino acid sequence the start of bkdb was identified from the n-terminal sequence of e2b isolated from branched-chain-oxoacid dehydrogenase of the closely related species p aeruginosa the reading frame was composed of 655 g  c with 823 of the codons ending in g or c there was no intergenic space between bkda2 and bkdb no codons requiring minor trnas were utilized and the codon bias index indicated a preferential codon usage the bkdb gene encoded 423 amino acids although the n-terminal methionine was absent from e2b prepared from p aeruginosa the relative molecular mass of the encoded protein was 45134 45003 minus methionine vs 47000 obtained by sdspolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis there was a single lipoyl domain in e2b compared to three lipoyl domains in e2p and one domain in e2o the transacylases of pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenases of escherichia coli respectively there was significant similarity between the lipoyl domain of e2b and of e2p and e2o as well as between the e1-e2 binding domains of e2b e2p and e2o there was no similarity between the e3 binding domain of e2b to e2p and e2o which may reflect the uniqueness of the e3 component of branched-chain-oxoacid dehydrogenase of p putida the conclusions drawn from these comparisons are that the transacylases of prokaryotic pyruvate 2-oxoglutarate and branched-chain-oxoacid dehydrogenases descended from a common ancestral protein probably at about the same time
E,a mutant was isolated that failed to derepress the 5' upstream region of candida tropicalis isocitrate lyase gene upr-icl-mediated gene expression in acetate medium and the gene fil1 that complemented this mutation was isolated the fil1 null mutant in which fil1 is disrupted deltafil1 strain could not grow on acetate or ethanol and the derepression of the isocitrate lyase encoded by icl1 in saccharomyces cerevisiae was also defected the amino acid sequence of fil1p 230 amino acids showed similarity to ribosome recycling factors rrfs of prokaryotes compared to prokaryotic rrfs fil1p had an n-terminal 46-amino-acid extension which was shown to be able to function as a mitochondrial-targeting sequence the subcellular fractionation of the deltafil1 strain showed that protein constituents of the mitochondrial fraction of the deltafil1 strain differed from those of the wild-type strain but resembled those of chloramphenicol-treated cells or rhoo cells the specific activity of cytochrome c oxidase was severely decreased in deltafil1 rhoo and chloramphenicol-treated cells compared with wild-type cells while enzymatic levels of mitochondrial nad-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase which is encoded by nuclear dna were not affected these results suggest that fillp is necessary for protein synthesis in mitochondria of s cerevisiae furthermore cells treated with antimycin a along with chloramphenicol-treated rhoo and deltafil1 cells showed deficiency in derepression of isocitrate lyase northern-blot analysis showed that this can be ascribed to no increase in transcription of icl1 and fbp1 encoding fructose 16-bisphosphatase the results indicate the presence of a communication pathway between mitochondria and the nucleus which represses expression of genes encoding the key enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle and gluconeogenic pathway when there is a deficiency in the mitochondrial respiratory chain
E,a novel serinethreonine protein kinase termed rac-pk has recently been identified and cloned from cdna libraries derived from the human cell lines mcf-7 and wi38 a second form of this protein kinase termed rac protein kinase beta has been identified from cdnas derived from the same cell lines these two closely related forms show 90 homology although the beta form with a predicted mr 60200 has a carboxyl terminal extension of 40 amino acids in comparison to the alpha form this extension has a high serine content with 11 serine residues in the last 30 amino acids the beta form of the protein has been shown by both in vitro translation and bacterial expression to be approximately 5000 da larger than the alpha form rac protein kinase beta is encoded by a 34-kb transcript and the alpha form is encoded by a 32-kb mrna using gene-specific probes both transcripts were detected in all cell types analyzed although levels of expression were different for the two forms the catalytic domain of rac protein kinase beta shows a high degree of homology to both the protein kinase c and cyclic amp-dependent protein kinase families and hence rac protein kinases appear to represent a new subfamily of the second messenger serinethreonine protein kinases
E,we have identified a novel protein p22 required for constitutive exocytic membrane traffic p22 belongs to the ef-hand superfamily of ca2-binding proteins and shows extensive similarity to the regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2b calcineurin b p22 is a cytosolic n-myristoylated protein that undergoes conformational changes upon binding of ca2 antibodies against a p22 peptide block the targetingfusion of transcytotic vesicles with the apical plasma membrane but recombinant wild-type p22 overcomes that inhibition nonmyristoylated p22 or p22 incapable of undergoing ca2-induced conformational changes cannot reverse the antibody-mediated inhibition the data suggest that p22 may act by transducing cellular ca2 signals to downstream effectors p22 is ubiquitously expressed and we propose that its function is required for membrane trafficking events common to many cells
B,the genome sequence of the solvent-producing bacterium clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 has been determined by the shotgun approach the genome consists of a 394-mb chromosome and a 192-kb megaplasmid that contains the majority of genes responsible for solvent production comparison of c acetobutylicum to bacillus subtilis reveals significant local conservation of gene order which has not been seen in comparisons of other genomes with similar or in some cases closer phylogenetic proximity this conservation allows the prediction of many previously undetected operons in both bacteria however the c acetobutylicum genome also contains a significant number of predicted operons that are shared with distantly related bacteria and archaea but not with b subtilis phylogenetic analysis is compatible with the dissemination of such operons by horizontal transfer the enzymes of the solventogenesis pathway and of the cellulosome of c acetobutylicum comprise a new set of metabolic capacities not previously represented in the collection of complete genomes these enzymes show a complex pattern of evolutionary affinities emphasizing the role of lateral gene exchange in the evolution of the unique metabolic profile of the bacterium many of the sporulation genes identified in b subtilis are missing in c acetobutylicum which suggests major differences in the sporulation process thus comparative analysis reveals both significant conservation of the genome organization and pronounced differences in many systems that reflect unique adaptive strategies of the two gram-positive bacteria
E,the cloning of a cdna encoding a g protein-coupled receptor homologous to the endothelin type b receptor but unable to bind endothelin was recently reported and termed etbr-lp we report here the isolation of a human cdna encoding a receptor that is highly related to etbr-lp and which was therefore termed etbr-lp-2 comparison of the two amino acid sequences revealed 68 overall homology and 48 identity as is the case for etbr-lp the new receptor is strongly expressed in the human central nervous system eg in cerebellar bergmann glia cerebral cortex internal capsule fibers membranes of hek-293 cells stably expressing etbr-lp-2 did not bind endothelin-1 endothelin-2 endothelin-3 bombesin cholecystokinin-8 or gastrin-releasing peptide
E,the complete 94192 bp sequence of the mitochondrial genome from race s of podospora anserina is presented 1 kb  103 base pairs three regions unique to race a are also presented bringing the size of this genome to 100314 bp race s contains 31 group i introns 33 in race a and 2 group ii introns 3 in race a analysis shows that the group i introns can be categorized according to families both with regard to secondary structure and their open reading frames all identified genes are transcribed from the same strand except for the lack of atpase 9 the podospora genome contains the same genes as its fungal counterparts n crassa and a nidulans about 20 of the genome has not yet been identified dna sequence studies of several excision-amplification plasmids demonstrate a common feature to be the presence of short repeated sequences at both termini with a prevalence of ggcgcaagctc
B,listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen with a high mortality rate that has also emerged as a paradigm for intracellular parasitism we present and compare the genome sequences of l monocytogenes 2944528 base pairs and a nonpathogenic species l innocua 3011209 base pairs we found a large number of predicted genes encoding surface and secreted proteins transporters and transcriptional regulators consistent with the ability of both species to adapt to diverse environments the presence of 270 l monocytogenes and 149 l innocua strain-specific genes clustered in 100 and 63 islets respectively suggests that virulence in listeria results from multiple gene acquisition and deletion events
E,expression of a female-specific cyp3a in the adult mouse liver was observed on immunoblotting analysis to characterize this cytochrome p450 we determined the primary structure of its cdna and examined its expression profile this cytochrome p450 consisted of 504 amino acids and showed 92 68 88 and 69 amino acid sequence identity with mouse cyp3a11 3a13 3a16 and 3a25 respectively and was designated as cyp3a41 a new mouse cyp3a gene in the female liver levels of cyp3a41 mrna expression were comparable to those of cyp3a11 the major cyp3a enzyme in the adult mouse liver expression of cyp3a41 mrna was detected immediately after birth in the livers of animals of both sexes but increased with age in females whereas it was gradually reduced in males resulting in predominantly female-specific expression in livers lesser amounts of cyp3a41 mrna were detected in the kidneys of female mice with traces in the stomach ovary and heart of female mice and in the testis of male mice gonadectomy and sex hormone treatment indicated that estradiol and testosterone were able to induce and suppress the expression of cyp3a41 mrna in the liver respectively among the classical cyp3a inducers dexamethasone rifampicin and 3-methylcholanthrene did not affect the level of cyp3a41 mrna in the liver of either sex on the other hand pregnenolone 16alpha-carbonitrile and phenobarbital suppressed cyp3a41 level to half that of untreated female mice these observations indicated that cyp3a41 is a female-specific cyp3a and one of the major cyp3a forms in the female mouse liver
E,actin depolymerizing factor adf is a key regulator of the organization of the actin cytoskeleton during various cellular activities we found that adf genes in arabidopsis form a large family consisting of at least nine members four of which were cloned and sequenced in this study comparison of genomic and cdna sequences showed that the atadf1 atadf5 and atadf6 genes all contain two introns at conserved positions analysis of transgenic arabidopsis plants carrying promoter-gus fusion constructs revealed that atadf1 and atadf6 are expressed in the vascular tissues of all organs whereas expression of atadf5 is restricted to the root tip meristem gfp-atadfi gfp-atadf5 and gfp-atadf6 fusion proteins were found to bind to actin filaments in vivo and to reorganize the actin cytoskeleton when transiently expressed in plant cells
E,the population of drosophila pseudoobscura at bogota columbia is geographically and partially reproductively isolated from populations in the main body of the species in north america the degree of genetic differentiation and time of divergence between populations at bogota and apple hill ca were estimated by comparison of 3388 nucleotides in the alcohol dehydrogenase region adh and adh-dup genes of 18 strains of the 146 polymorphic nucleotide sites detected 68 and 31 were unique to the apple hill and bogota samples respectively and 53 were shared on the basis of an observed net divergence per nucleotide site of 0264 between the two samples the bogota and north american populations were estimated to have been separated for at least 155000 years this divergence time suggests that d pseudoobscura extended its range from north america to south america in a period of pleistocene glaciation when habitat suitable for the species presumably existed in lowland central america
E,the mouse c5a receptor gene was isolated using the human c5a receptor cdna probe recently described gerard n p and c gerard 1991 nature 349614 by analogy with the human gene the mouse homolog contains two exons with the 5' untranslated region and initiating methionine codon present in exon 1 and the remainder of the molecule in exon 2 generation of an expressible cdna for the mouse c5a receptor was accomplished using the polymerase chain reaction and a sense oligodeoxynucleotide primer which included an initiation codon just 5' to the sequence encoding the n-linked glycosylation site when transfected into human 293 kidney epithelial cells the cloned cdna directs expression of a binding site for human c5a anaphylatoxin with a binding constant of 25 - 03 nm the human c5a receptor expressed under identical conditions has a kd of 17 - 02 nm overall the deduced amino acid sequences of the receptors are 65 identical given the analogous gene structures alignment of the sequences as seven transmembrane segment receptors reveals that the greatest structural diversity approximately 70 exists in the putative extracellular domains in contrast species differences among other members of this family of seven membrane-spanning receptors is generally only 10 to 20 even for receptors whose ligands are relatively small and not expected to interact with sites on the extracellular surfaces a high degree of structural identify is observed for the c5a receptors in the transmembrane segments and in all but one of the loops predicted to exist in the cytoplasm inasmuch as critical structures responsible for high affinity binding of the 74 amino acid polypeptide to both c5a receptors involve features conserved between species these data provide the starting point for mutagenesis studies to determine the nature of the binding and activation sites for the chemotactic receptors additionally these data provide a reagent for immunologic and molecular genetic studies on the role of c5a receptors in inflammatory models
B,the first committed step in the biosynthetic pathway of carotenoids in plants and algae is the conversion of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate ggpp to prephytoene pyrophosphate pppp which is converted to phytoene we have cloned the gene pys that encodes the enzyme phytoene synthase in the cyanobacterium synechococcus pcc7942 the co-expression of pys in cells of escherichia coli together with the gene crte from erwinia uredovora which encodes geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase resulted in accumulation of phytoene this result indicates that phytoene synthase is a single polypeptide enzyme that catalyzes the 2-step reaction from ggpp to phytoene the deduced amino acid sequence of pys is highly conserved with that of ptom5 a tomato cdna that is differentially expressed during fruit ripening these findings suggest that ptom5 encodes phytoene synthase in tomato
E,we have identified and characterized a new calciumcalmodulin ca2cam dependent protein kinase termed death-associated protein kinase 2 dapk2 that contains an n-terminal protein kinase domain followed by a conserved cam-binding domain with significant homologies to those of dap kinase a protein kinase involved in apoptosis dapk2 mrna is expressed abundantly in heart lung and skeletal muscle the mapping results indicated that dapk2 is located in the central region of mouse chromosome 9 in vitro kinase assay revealed that dapk2 is autophosphorylated and phosphorylates myosin light chain mlc as an exogenous substrate dapk2 binds directly to cam and is activated in a ca2cam-dependent manner a constitutively active dapk2 mutant is generated by removal of the cam-binding domain deltacam treatment of agonists that elevate intracellular ca2-concentration led to the activation of dapk2 and transfection studies revealed that dapk2 is localized in the cytoplasm overexpression of dapk2 but not the kinase negative mutant significantly induced the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis these results indicate that dapk2 is an additional member of dap kinase family involved in apoptotic signaling
E,there are 14 species of marmots distributed across the holarctic and despite extensive systematic study their phylogenetic relationships remain largely unresolved in particular comprehensive studies have been lacking a well-supported phylogeny is needed to place the numerous ecological and behavioral studies on marmots in an evolutionary context to address this situation we obtained complete cytochrome cyt b sequences for 13 of the species and a partial sequence for the 14th we applied a statistical approach to both phylogeny estimation and hypothesis testing using parsimony and maximum likelihood-based methods we conducted statistical tests on a suite of previously proposed hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships and biogeographic histories the cyt b data strongly support the monophyly of marmota and a western montane clade in the nearctic although some other scenarios cannot be rejected the results are consistent with an initial diversification in north america followed by an invasion and subsequent rapid diversification in the palearctic these analyses reject the two major competing hypotheses of m broweri's phylogenetic relationships--namely that it is the sister species to m camtschatica of eastern siberia and that it is related closely to m caligata of the nearctic the alaskan distribution of m broweri is best explained as a reinvasion from the palearctic but a nearctic origin can not be rejected several other conventionally recognized species groups can also be rejected social evolution has been homoplastic with large colonial systems evolving in two groups convergently the cyt b data do not provide unambiguous resolution of several basal nodes in the palearctic radiation leaving some aspects of pelage and karyotypic evolution equivocal
E,the mouse agouti gene controls the deposition of yellow and black pigment in developing hairs several dominant alleles including lethal yellow ay result in the exclusive production of yellow pigment and have pleiotropic effects that include obesity and increased tumor susceptibility in an interspecific backcross we established genetic limits for the agouti gene and found that the ay and the lethal non-agouti ax allele were not separated from a previously identified probe at the breakpoint of the is1gso chromosomal rearrangement using the is1gso probe we isolated the agouti gene and find that it has the potential to code for a secreted protein expressed in hair follicles and the epidermis and that the level of expression correlates with the synthesis of yellow pigment in the ay mutation there is a chromosomal rearrangement that results in the production of a chimeric rna expressed in nearly every tissue of the body the 5' portion of this chimeric rna contains highly expressed novel 5' sequences but the 3' portion retains the protein-coding potential of the nonmutant allele we speculate that dominant pleiotropic effects of ay are caused by ectopic activation of a signaling pathway similar to that used during normal hair growth
E,cdna clones of the human c-fes mrna were isolated nucleotide analysis showed that c-fes mrna contains a 2514 nucleotide open reading frame which could encode for a 93 kda protein and both 5' and 3' v-fes nonhomologous sequences primer extension experiments confirmed that the longest isolated cdnas are about the same length as the entire human c-fes mrna sequence comparison between human c-fes cdna and the corresponding genomic regions identified a 5' viral-non homologous exon exon 1 located 491 bp upstream from the first v-fes homologous exon the genomic region surrounding c-fes exon 1 contains a cpg island and acts as a promoter in vitro analysis of the 5' end of mouse c-fes cdna suggested that the 5' human and mouse gene structure are similar
E,crustacean hyperglycemic hormone chh is a multifunctional neurohormone produced in the eyestalk of crustaceans and is primarily involved in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism in several crustacean species chh isoforms with identical amino acid sequences and molecular masses but with different chromatographic elution patterns are synthesized to obtain sequence information on the chh preprohormone in the crayfish orconectes limosus we isolated two full-length cdnas encoding two structurally different preprochh species the sequences of these precursors differ slightly in the signal peptide the chh-precursor-related peptidecprp-coding sequences and in the non-coding regions but are identical in the chh peptide-coding sequence determination of the levels of preprochh mrnas and the amount of chh peptide in the eyestalks of individual animals revealed that the ratio between the two preprochh mrnas varies for different individuals while the ratio between the two chh peptide isoforms does not differ among animals our results suggest that the existence of two chh isoforms in the crayfish o limosus is due to a post-translational modification event northern-blot analysis showed only one band in eyestalk tissue with a size of approximately 24 kb similar to the sizes of the cdna sequences southern-blot analysis revealed the presence of at least two preprochh genes in the crayfish suggesting a gene duplication event slight modifications in the duplicated genes could be responsible for the existence of the two preprochh-encoding mrnas
B,the genome sequences of chlamydia trachomatis mouse pneumonitis mopn strain nigg 1 069 412 nt and chlamydia pneumoniae strain ar39 1 229 853 nt were determined using a random shotgun strategy the mopn genome exhibited a general conservation of gene order and content with the previously sequenced ctrachomatis serovar d differences between ctrachomatis strains were focused on an approximately 50 kb 'plasticity zone' near the termination origins in this region mopn contained three copies of a novel gene encoding a 3000 amino acid toxin homologous to a predicted toxin from escherichia coli o157h7 but had apparently lost the tryptophan biosyntheis genes found in serovar d in this region the c pneumoniae ar39 chromosome was 999 identical to the previously sequenced cpneumoniae cwl029 genome however comparative analysis identified an invertible dna segment upstream of the uridine kinase gene which was in different orientations in the two genomes ar39 also contained a novel 4524 nt circular single-stranded ssdna bacteriophage the first time a virus has been reported infecting c pneumoniae although the chlamydial genomes were highly conserved there were intriguing differences in key nucleotide salvage pathways cpneumoniae has a uridine kinase gene for dutp production mopn has a uracil phosphororibosyl transferase while ctrachomatis serovar d contains neither gene chromosomal comparison revealed that there had been multiple large inversion events since the species divergence of ctrachomatis and cpneumoniae apparently oriented around the axis of the origin of replication and the termination region the striking synteny of the chlamydia genomes and prevalence of tandemly duplicated genes are evidence of minimal chromosome rearrangement and foreign gene uptake presumably owing to the ecological isolation of the obligate intracellular parasites in the absence of genetic analysis comparative genomics will continue to provide insight into the virulence mechanisms of these important human pathogens
B,listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen with a high mortality rate that has also emerged as a paradigm for intracellular parasitism we present and compare the genome sequences of l monocytogenes 2944528 base pairs and a nonpathogenic species l innocua 3011209 base pairs we found a large number of predicted genes encoding surface and secreted proteins transporters and transcriptional regulators consistent with the ability of both species to adapt to diverse environments the presence of 270 l monocytogenes and 149 l innocua strain-specific genes clustered in 100 and 63 islets respectively suggests that virulence in listeria results from multiple gene acquisition and deletion events
B,the plasmid pya902 with the dextranase dex gene of streptococcus sobrinus uab66 serotype g produces a c-terminal truncated dextranase enzyme dex with a multicomplex mass form which ranges from 80 to 130 kda the escherichia coli-produced enzyme was purified and characterized and antibodies were raised in rabbits purified dextranase has a native-form molecular mass of 160 to 260 kda and specific activity of 4000 umg of protein potential immunological cross-reactivity between dextranase and the spaa protein specified by various recombinant clones was studied by using various antisera and western blot immunoblot analysis no cross-reactivity was observed optimal ph 53 and temperature 39 degrees c and the isoelectric points 356 36 and 37 were determined and found to be similar to those for dextranase purified from s sobrinus the dex dna restriction map was determined and several subclones were obtained the nucleotide sequence of the dex gene was determined by using subclones pya993 and pya3009 and uab66 chromosomal dna the open reading frame for dex was 4011 bp ending with a stop codon taa a ribosome-binding site and putative promoter preceding the start codon were identified the deduced amino acid sequence of dex revealed the presence of a signal peptide of 30 amino acids the cleavage site for the signal sequence was determined by n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis for dex produced in e coli chi 2831pya902 the c terminus consists of a serine- and threonine-rich region followed by the peptide lpktgd 3 charged amino acids 19 amino acids with a strongly hydrophobic character and a charged pentapeptide tail which are proposed to correspond to the cell wall-spanning region the lpxtgx consensus sequence and the membrane-anchoring domains of surface-associated proteins of gram-positive cocci
E,we have characterized two previously cloned genes f1 and f2 1 that code for elongation factor ef - 1 alpha of drosophila melanogaster genomic southern blot hybridization revealed that they are the only gene copies present we isolated cdna clones of both transcripts from embryonal and pupal stage of development that cover the entire transcription unit the 5' ends of both genes have been determined by primer extension and for f1 also by rna sequencing these start sites have been shown to be used consistently during development comparison of cdna and genomic sequences revealed that ef - 1 alphaf1 consists of two and ef - 1 alphaf2 of five exons the two described elongation factor genes exhibit several regions of strong sequence conservation when compared to five recently cloned eucaryotic elongation factors
E,the complete nucleotide sequence of the chloroplast genome of arabidopsis thaliana has been determined the genome as a circular dna composed of 154478 bp containing a pair of inverted repeats of 26264 bp which are separated by small and large single copy regions of 17780 bp and 84170 bp respectively a total of 87 potential protein-coding genes including 8 genes duplicated in the inverted repeat regions 4 ribosomal rna genes and 37 trna genes 30 gene species representing 20 amino acid species were assigned to the genome on the basis of similarity to the chloroplast genes previously reported for other species the translated amino acid sequences from respective potential protein-coding genes showed 639 to 100 sequence similarity to those of the corresponding genes in the chloroplast genome of nicotiana tabacum indicating the occurrence of significant diversity in the chloroplast genes between two dicot plants the sequence data and gene information are available on the world wide web database kaos kazusa arabidopsis data opening site at httpwwwkazusaorjparabi
B,a gene coding for an extracellular zn-carboxypeptidase of thermoactinomyces vulgaris has been cloned and sequenced embl x56901 this enzyme named carboxypeptidase t reveals simultaneously both types of substrate specificity characteristic of mammalian carboxypeptidases a and b the carboxypeptidase t gene is primarily expressed in e coli as a non-active preproenzyme with an additional 98 amino acid residues at the n-terminus primary structure alignment of mature carboxypeptidase t and mammalian metallocarboxypeptidases demonstrated 25-30 overall identity but a full preservation of presumed catalytically important residues these observations imply a basic uniformity of the general catalytic mechanism for enzymes of that class produced by evolutionarily remote organisms
B,the eight genes which encode the f1fo h-atpase in lactococcus lactis subsp cremoris mg1363 were cloned and sequenced the genes were organized in an operon with the gene order atpebfhagdc ie the order of atpe and atpb is reversed with respect to the more typical bacterial organization the deduced amino acid sequences of the corresponding h-atpase subunits showed significant homology with the subunits from other organisms results of northern blot analysis showed a transcript at approximately 7 kb which corresponds to the size of the atp operon the transcription initiation site was mapped by primer extension and coincided with a standard promoter sequence in order to analyze the importance of the h-atpase for l lactis physiology a mutant strain was constructed in which the original atp promoter on the chromosome was replaced with an inducible nisin promoter when grown on gm17 plates the resulting strain was completely dependent on the presence of nisin for growth these data demonstrate that the h-atpase is essential for growth of l lactis under these conditions
B,salmonella typhimurium synthesizes cobalamin vitamin b12 de novo under anaerobic conditions of the 30 cobalamin synthetic genes 25 are clustered in one operon cob and are arranged in three groups each group encoding enzymes for a biochemically distinct portion of the biosynthetic pathway we have determined the dna sequence for the promoter region and the proximal 171 kb of the cob operon this sequence includes 20 translationally coupled genes that encode the enzymes involved in parts i and iii of the cobalamin biosynthetic pathway a comparison of these genes with the cobalamin synthetic genes from pseudomonas denitrificans allows assignment of likely functions to 12 of the 20 sequenced salmonella genes three additional salmonella genes encode proteins likely to be involved in the transport of cobalt a component of vitamin b12 however not all salmonella and pseudomonas cobalamin synthetic genes have apparent homologs in the other species these differences suggest that the cobalamin biosynthetic pathways differ between the two organisms the evolution of these genes and their chromosomal positions is discussed
B,the bacterium escherichia coli o157h7 is a worldwide threat to public health and has been implicated in many outbreaks of haemorrhagic colitis some of which included fatalities caused by haemolytic uraemic syndrome close to 75000 cases of o157h7 infection are now estimated to occur annually in the united states the severity of disease the lack of effective treatment and the potential for large-scale outbreaks from contaminated food supplies have propelled intensive research on the pathogenesis and detection of e coli o157h7 ref 4 here we have sequenced the genome of e coli o157h7 to identify candidate genes responsible for pathogenesis to develop better methods of strain detection and to advance our understanding of the evolution of e coli through comparison with the genome of the non-pathogenic laboratory strain e coli k-12 ref 5 we find that lateral gene transfer is far more extensive than previously anticipated in fact 1387 new genes encoded in strain-specific clusters of diverse sizes were found in o157h7 these include candidate virulence factors alternative metabolic capacities several prophages and other new functions--all of which could be targets for surveillance
B,comparison of two fully sequenced genomes of buchnera aphidicola the obligate endosymbionts of aphids reveals the most extreme genome stability to date no chromosome rearrangements or gene acquisitions have occurred in the past 50 to 70 million years despite substantial sequence evolution and the inactivation and loss of individual genes in contrast the genomes of their closest free-living relatives escherichia coli and salmonella spp are more than 2000-fold more labile in content and gene order the genomic stasis of b aphidicola likely attributable to the loss of phages repeated sequences and reca indicates that b aphidicola is no longer a source of ecological innovation for its hosts
E,the complete amino acid sequence of a basic liver fatty acid-binding protein l-fabp from catfish rhamdia sapo was determined alignment of sequences shows that it has more similarity to chicken basic l-fabp than to mammalian l-fabp the phylogenetic analysis suggests that basic l-fabp from catfish chicken and iguana diverged from the mammalian protein before the fish-tetrapod divergence thus implying that the two types are encoded by different genes supporting this conclusion a 14-kda protein structurally closely related to mammalian l-fabp was isolated from catfish intestine indicating the presence of the two genes in the same species the catfish basic l-fabp binds only one fatty acidmolecule while mammalian l-fabp bind two the former has more affinity for trans-parinaric acid than for cis-parinaric acid in constrast to the latter proteins
B,listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen with a high mortality rate that has also emerged as a paradigm for intracellular parasitism we present and compare the genome sequences of l monocytogenes 2944528 base pairs and a nonpathogenic species l innocua 3011209 base pairs we found a large number of predicted genes encoding surface and secreted proteins transporters and transcriptional regulators consistent with the ability of both species to adapt to diverse environments the presence of 270 l monocytogenes and 149 l innocua strain-specific genes clustered in 100 and 63 islets respectively suggests that virulence in listeria results from multiple gene acquisition and deletion events
E,we have recently identified a new g protein-coupled receptor x-msr whose expression is associated with the endothelial lineage in xenopus laevis devic e paquereau l vernier p knibiehler b audigier y 1996 expression of a new g protein-coupled receptor x-msr is associated with an endothelial lineage in xenopus laevis mech dev 59 129-140 based on its structural analogy to the human orphan receptor apj we cloned the murine msrapj receptor and analyzed its expression in developing tissues as observed for x-msr msrapj transcripts are detected in the endothelium of the primary blood vessels and the forming heart in addition they are expressed in somites limb bud and branchial arches this expression pattern is distinct from that of the flk1 gene and suggests that the msrapj gene is expressed in a subpopulation of endothelial precursors and a mesenchymal population derived from paraaxial mesoderm
E,the amino terminal sequence of the 34 kd nucleolar protein b-36 isolated from the slime mold physarum polycephalum has been determined this portion of b-36 is rich in glycine phenylalanine and the modified amino acid asymmetrical dimethylarginine dma and is 65 identical to that for fibrillarin a similar and potentially homologous 34 kd nucleolar protein from rat the terminus of b-36 contains an interesting nine amino acid sequence gly-dma-gly-gly-phe-gly-gly-dma-gly which is precisely repeated three times in the 110 kd nucleolar protein nucleolin similar sequences have also been reported in a yeast nucleolar protein ssb-1 and several hnrnp proteins rat a1 and brine shrimp grp33 the conserved nature of this unusual sequence is suggestive of an important function which may include rna-binding since several of these proteins share this feature
E,using the polymerase chain reaction an a3 adenosine receptor has been cloned from the hypophysial par tuberalis of sheep the clone encodes a 317-amino acid protein that is 72 identical to the rat a3 adenosine receptor in contrast to rat where abundant a3 mrna transcript is found primarily in testis the sheep transcript is most abundant in lung spleen and pineal gland and is present in moderate levels in brain kidney and testis the agonist n6-amino125iiodobenzyladenosine binds with high affinity kd congruent to 6 nm and specificity to recombinant a3 adenosine receptors expressed transiently in cos-1 cells or stably in cho k1 cells the potency order of agonists is n6-aminoiodobenzyladenosine  n-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine  or  r-phenylisopropyladenosine  cyclopentyladenosine little or no binding of purine nucleotides was detected the potency order of antagonists is 3-3-iodo-4-aminobenzyl-8-4-oxyacetatephenyl-1- propylxanthine i-abopx ki  3 nm  13-dipropyl-8-4-acrylatephenylxanthine bw-a1433  13-dipropyl-8-sulfophenylxanthine  xanthine amine cogener  8-cyclopentyl-13-dipropylxanthine enprofylline does not bind these data indicate that in contrast to a1 adenosine receptors a3 adenosine receptors preferentially bind ligands with aryl rings in the n6-position of adenine and in the c8-position of xanthine among antagonists the a3 adenosine receptor preferentially binds 8-phenylxanthines with acidic versus basic para-substituents i-abopx  bw-a1433  13-dipropyl-8-sulfophenylxanthine  xanthine amine cogener agonists reduce forskolin-stimulated camp accumulation in chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with recombinant sheep a3 adenosine receptors the reduction is blocked by bw-a1433 but not by 8-cyclopentyl-13-dipropylxanthine these data suggest that i a3 adenosine receptors display unusual structural diversity for species homologs ii in contrast to rat sheep a3 adenosine receptors have a broad tissue distribution and iii some xanthines with acidic side chains bind with high affinity to a3 adenosine receptors
E,the primary structure of l-histidine decarboxylase hdc l-histidine carboxy-lyase ec 41122 from mouse mastocytoma p-815 cells has been determined by parallel analysis of the amino acid sequence of the protein and the nucleotide sequence of the corresponding cdna hdc contains 662 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 74017 which is larger by about 21000 da than that of the previously purified hdc subunit 53 kda suggesting that hdc might be posttranslationally processed the hdc cdna hybridized to a 27 kilobase mrna of mastocytoma cells homology was found between the sequences of mouse mastocytoma hdc and fetal rat liver hdc
E,the complete nucleotide sequence of a 39090 bp segment from the left arm of yeast chromosome iv was determined twenty-one open reading frames orfs longer than 100 amino acids and a gly-trna gene were discovered nine of the 21 orfs d0892 d1022 d1037 d1045 d1057 d1204 d1209 d1214 d1219 correspond to the previously sequenced saccharomyces cerevisiae genes for the nad-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase gdh the secretory component shr3 the gaba transport protein uga4 the high mobility group-like protein nhp2 the hydroxymethylbilane synthase hem3 the methylated dna protein-cysteine s-methyltransferase mgt1 a putative sugar transport protein the shm1 protein shm1 and the anti-silencing protein asf2 the inferred amino acid sequences of 11 orfs show significant similarity with known proteins from various organisms whereas the remaining orf does not share any similarity with known proteins
E,dystrophin-related and -associated proteins are important in the formation and maintenance of the mammalian neuromuscular junction we have characterized mouse cdna clones encoding isoforms of the dystrophin-homologous 87-kda postsynaptic protein dystrobrevin in torpedo the 87-kda protein is multiply phosphorylated and closely associated with proteins in the postsynaptic cytoskeleton including the acetylcholine receptor in contrast to torpedo where only a single transcript is seen the mouse expresses several mrnas encoding different isoforms a 60-kilobase transcript in brain encodes a 78-kda protein dystrobrevin-2 that has a different c terminus lacking the putative tyrosine kinase substrate domain in skeletal and cardiac muscle transcripts of 17 and 3335 kilobases predominate and encode additional isoforms alternative splicing within the coding region and differential usage of untranslated regions produce additional variation multiple dystrobrevin-immunoreactive proteins copurify with syntrophin from mouse tissues in skeletal muscle dystrobrevin immunoreactivity is restricted to the neuromuscular junction and sarcolemma the occurrence of many dystrobrevin isoforms is significant because alternative splicing and phosphorylation often have profound effects upon the biological activity of synaptic proteins
E,we have identified a family of abundant acidic human keratinocyte proteins with apparent molecular masses ranging between 30000 and 31100 isoelectric focussing sample spot proteins 9109 epithelial marker stratifin 9124 9125 9126 and 9231 in the master two-dimensional gel database of human keratinocyte proteins that share peptide sequences with each other with protein 14-3-3 and with the kinase c inhibitory protein immunofluorescence staining of keratinocytes showed that two of these proteins ief ssps 9124 and 9126 localize to the golgi apparatus while stratifin is distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm significant levels of stratifin and in smaller amount the sample spot proteins 9124 9125 and 9126 were detected in the medium of cultured human keratinocytes suggesting that they are partially secreted by these cells two-dimensional gel analysis of proteins from cultured human cells and fetal tissues showed that polypeptides comigrating with proteins 9124 9125 and 9126 are ubiquitous and highly expressed in the brain stratifin however was present only in cultured epithelial cells and was most abundant in fetal and adult human tissues enriched in stratified squamous keratinising epithelium we have cloned and sequenced cdnas coding for members of this family the complete identity of the sequenced peptides from stratifin with the amino acid sequence translated from the stratifin cdna clone indicated that this cdna codes for stratifin the identity of clones 1054 hs1 and as1 is less clear as with few exceptions none of the individual peptide sequences fits the predicted protein sequences the polypeptides synthesized by clones 1054 and hs1 in the vaccinia expression system on the other hand comigrate with proteins 9126 and 9124 suggesting cell-type-specific expression of members of the protein family database searches indicated that clone hs1 corresponds to a human t-cell cdna 14-3-3 clone while the high level of similarity of clones 1054 and as1 with the 14-3-3 beta and eta sequences respectively suggested that they code for the human equivalent of the two bovine proteins microsequence data indicated that ief ssp 9124 corresponds to the human homolog of bovine 14-3-3 gamma
E,evolutionary history of muscicapidae flycatchers is inferred from nuclear and mitochondrial dna mtdna sequence comparisons and population genetic analysis of nuclear and mtdna markers phylogenetic reconstruction based on sequences from the two genomes yielded similar trees with respect to the order at which the species split off however the genetic distances fitted a nonlinear polynomial model reflecting diminishing divergence rate of the mtdna sequences compared to the nuclear dna sequences this could be explained by haldane's rule because genetic isolation might evolve more rapidly on the mitochondrial rather than the nuclear genome in birds this is because hybrid sterility of the heterogametic sex females would predate that of the homogametic sex males leading to sex biased introgression of nuclear genes analyses of present hybrid zones of pied ficedula hypoleuca and collared flycatchers f albicollis may indicate a slight sexual bias in rate of introgression but the introgression rates were too low to allow proper statistical analyses it is suggested however that the observed deviation from linearity can be explained by a more rapid mutational saturation of the mtdna sequences than of the nuclear dna sequences as supported by analyses of third codon position transversions at two protein coding mtdna genes a phylogeographic scenario for the black and white flycatcher species is suggested based on interpretation of the genetic data obtained four species appear to have diverged from a common ancestor relatively simultaneously during the pleistocene after the last glaciation period pied and collared flycatchers expanded their breeding ranges and eventually came into secondary contact in central and eastern europe and on the baltic isles
E,the national institutes of health mammalian gene collection mgc program is a multiinstitutional effort to identify and sequence a cdna clone containing a complete orf for each human and mouse gene ests were generated from libraries enriched for full-length cdnas and analyzed to identify candidate full-orf clones which then were sequenced to high accuracy the mgc has currently sequenced and verified the full orf for a nonredundant set of 9000 human and 6000 mouse genes candidate full-orf clones for an additional 7800 human and 3500 mouse genes also have been identified all mgc sequences and clones are available without restriction through public databases and clone distribution networks see httpmgcncinihgov
B,the arginine succinyltransferase ast pathway is the major arginine and ornithine utilization aru pathway under aerobic conditions in pseudomonas aeruginosa a 26-kb dna fragment of the p aeruginosa pao1 chromosome carrying the regulatory argr gene and the aru structural gene cluster was cloned complementation tests and nucleotide sequence data established the locations of the argr aruc aruf arug arud arub and arue genes in that order the arur aruc arud arub and arue genes specify the argr regulatory protein n2-succinylornithine 5-aminotransferase n-succinylglutamate 5-semialdehyde dehydrogenase n2-succinylarginine dihydrolase and n-succinylglutamate desuccinylase respectively and the aruf and arug genes encode the subunits aruai and aruaii of arginine and ornithine n2-succinyltransferases furthermore in vivo analysis of transcriptional aru fusions and of polar insertion mutations located at different sites in the aru cluster indicated the presence of three transcriptional units which are controlled by argr the arucfgdb genes appear to form an operon transcribed from a promoter upstream of aruc whereas arue has its own promoter the argr gene which is located upstream of the arucfgdb operon is a member of another aot operon coding for arginine transport genes the deduced amino acid sequences of the ast enzymes were compared to those of homologous proteins of escherichia coli specified by the ast genes lying in the chromosome region from 392 to 395 min kohara clone 327 genbankemblddjb accession no d90818 the overall organization of the aru and ast genes in both organisms is similar with the exception that e coli appears to have a single ast gene
B,the 3385 kb of the escherichia coli genome described here together with previously described segments bring the total of contiguous finished sequence of this genome to  1 mb of 319 open reading frames orfs found in this 3385 kb segment 147 46 are potential new genes the positions of several genes which had been previously located here by mapping or partial sequencing have been confirmed several orfs have functions suggested by similarities to other characterised genes but cannot be assigned with certainty fifteen of the orfs of unknown function had been previously sequenced eight transfer rnas are encoded in the region and there are two grey holes in which no features were found the attachment site for phage p4 and three insertion sequences were located the region was also analysed for chi sites bend sites rep elements and other repeats a computer search identified potential promoters and tentative transcription units were assigned the occurrence of the rare tetramer ctag was analysed in 16 mb of contiguous ecoli sequence hypotheses addressing the rarity and distribution of ctag are discussed
E,extra sex combs esc is one of the polycomb group genes whose products are required for long term maintenance of the spatially restricted domains of homeotic gene expression initially established by the products of the segmentation genes we recently showed that the esc protein contains five copies of the wd motif which in other proteins has been directly implicated in protein-protein interactions mutations affecting the wd repeats of the esc protein indicate that they are essential for its function as a repressor of the homeotic genes we proposed that they may mediate interactions between esc and other polycomb group proteins recruiting them to their target genes perhaps by additional interactions with transiently expressed repressors such as hunchback to further investigate the functional importance of the wd motifs and identify other functionally important regions of the esc protein we have begun to determine its evolutionary conservation by characterizing the esc gene from drosophila virilis a distantly related drosophila species we show that the esc protein is highly conserved between these species particularly its wd motifs their high degree of conservation particularly at positions which are not conserved in the wd consensus derived from alignment of all known wd motifs suggests that each of the wd repeats in the esc protein is functionally specialized and that this specialization has been highly conserved during evolution its highly charged n-terminus exhibits the greatest divergence but even these differences are conservative of its predicted physical properties these observations suggest that the esc protein is functionally compact nearly every residue making an important contribution to its function
E,background most eukaryotic genomes include a substantial repeat-rich fraction termed heterochromatin which is concentrated in centric and telomeric regions the repetitive nature of heterochromatic sequence makes it difficult to assemble and analyze to better understand the heterochromatic component of the drosophila melanogaster genome we characterized and annotated portions of a whole-genome shotgun sequence assembly results wgs3 an improved whole-genome shotgun assembly includes 207 mb of draft-quality sequence not represented in the release 3 sequence spanning the euchromatin we annotated this sequence using the methods employed in the re-annotation of the release 3 euchromatic sequence this analysis predicted 297 protein-coding genes and six non-protein-coding genes including known heterochromatic genes and regions of similarity to known transposable elements bacterial artificial chromosome bac-based fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was used to correlate the genomic sequence with the cytogenetic map in order to refine the genomic definition of the centric heterochromatin on the basis of our cytological definition the annotated release 3 euchromatic sequence extends into the centric heterochromatin on each chromosome arm conclusions whole-genome shotgun assembly produced a reliable draft-quality sequence of a significant part of the drosophila heterochromatin annotation of this sequence defined the intron-exon structures of 30 known protein-coding genes and 267 protein-coding gene models the cytogenetic mapping suggests that an additional 150 predicted genes are located in heterochromatin at the base of the release 3 euchromatic sequence our analysis suggests strategies for improving the sequence and annotation of the heterochromatic portions of the drosophila and other complex genomes
E,peptides of the allatostatin superfamily with the c-terminal amino acid sequence -yxfgl-nh2 have been isolated and identified from the lepidopterans the codling moth cydia pomonella tortricidae and the bollworm helicoverpa armigera noctuidae the peptides designated cydiastatins and helicostatins respectively were monitored during purification with radioimmunoassays based on the callatostatins of the blowfly calliphora vomitoria the eight peptides from each of the two species appear to form an homologous series with four identical and three that differ by a single amino acid this study demonstrates the ubiquitous nature of this family of peptides in insects
E,the cdna clones corresponding to soybean beta-amylase mrna were isolated and sequenced the cdna contained an open-reading frame composed of 496 amino acids the comparison of the amino acid sequence deduced from the cdna with the n-terminal peptide sequence from mature enzyme proved that beta-amylase had no leader sequence employing the cdna the beta-amylase was directly synthesized in escherichia coli by the expression vector pkk233-2 controlled by the tac promoter the enzyme activity detected in e coli lysate drastically increased with a lower cultivation temperature and the total activity and specific activity of the enzyme in e coli lysate cultured at 13 degrees c was 130-fold and 280-fold respectively the value at 37 degrees c the enzyme produced in e coli was purified by the affinity column chromatography of cyclomaltohexaose-immobilized sepharose 6b employing the established expression and purification system of the enzyme the functional ionizable groups in the active site were searched his93 involving an imidazole and asp348 involving a carboxylate in the highly conserved regions within the beta-amylases were replaced by arg h93r and ash d348n by site-directed mutagenesis respectively all beta-amylases including the non-mutant and mutant beta-amylases produced in e coli exhibited lower vmax values than that of beta-amylase isolated conventionally from soybean seeds especially the vmax value of h93rbeta-amylase was reduced drastically compared to that of the non-mutant however none of them lost their enzyme activities completely therefore neither his93 nor asp348 may participate in the catalytic reaction directly
E,contryphans are unusual conus peptides which contain a distinctive post-translational modification d-tryptophan or d-leucine cdna clones encoding new contryphans from the mollusc-hunting cone snail conus textile were identified and the inferred mature peptides were synthesized contryphan-tx gly-cys-hyp-d-trp-gln-pro-tyr-cys-nh2 leu-contryphan-tx cys-val-d-leu-tyr-pro-trp-cys-nh2 and contryphan rtx which is identical to contryphan-r jimenez et al 1996 contryphan is a d-tryptophan containing conus peptide j biol chem 281 28002-28005 leu-contryphan-tx exhibits a single peak but contryphan-tx shows two peaks under reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography conditions ultraviolet resonance raman spectroscopy demonstrates a difference in the d-tryptophan dihedral angle for the two contryphan-tx equilibrium conformers both the sequences and in vivo effects of all contryphans isolated suggest that there are two major branches of the contryphan family
B,pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that is one of the top three causes of opportunistic human infections a major factor in its prominence as a pathogen is its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants here we report the complete sequence of p aeruginosa strain pao1 at 63 million base pairs this is the largest bacterial genome sequenced and the sequence provides insights into the basis of the versatility and intrinsic drug resistance of p aeruginosa consistent with its larger genome size and environmental adaptability p aeruginosa contains the highest proportion of regulatory genes observed for a bacterial genome and a large number of genes involved in the catabolism transport and efflux of organic compounds as well as four potential chemotaxis systems we propose that the size and complexity of the p aeruginosa genome reflect an evolutionary adaptation permitting it to thrive in diverse environments and resist the effects of a variety of antimicrobial substances
E,leishmania parasites are exposed to pronounced changes in their environment during their life cycle as they migrate from the sandfly midgut to the insect proboscis and then into the phagolysosomes of the vertebrate macrophages the developmental transformations that produce each life cycle stage of the parasite may be signaled in part by binding of environmental ligands to receptors which mediate transduction of extracellular signals we have identified a family of five clustered genes in leishmania donovani which may encode signal transduction receptors the coding regions of two of these genes designated rac-a and rac-b have been sequenced and shown to code for proteins with an nh2-terminal hydrophilic domain an intervening putative transmembrane segment and a cooh-terminal domain that has high sequence identity to the catalytic domain from adenylate cyclases in other eukaryotes we have expressed the receptor-adenylate cyclase protein rac-a protein in xenopus oocytes and demonstrated that it functions as an adenylate cyclase although rac-b exhibits no catalytic activity when expressed in oocytes co-expression of rac-a and rac-b negatively regulates the adenylate cyclase activity of rac-a suggesting that these two proteins interact in the membrane furthermore a truncated version of rac-a functions as a dominant negative mutant that inhibits the catalytic activity of the wild type receptor the rac-a and rac-b genes encode developmentally regulated mrnas which are expressed in the insect stage but not in the mammalian host stage of the parasite life cycle
B,the genes encoding the two different subunits of the electron transfer flavoprotein etf from the methylotrophic bacterium w3a1 have been identified cloned and sequenced a 08-kilobase pair dna fragment was generated for use as a molecular probe by the amplification of genomic sequences using the polymerase chain reaction and a primer pair with degenerate sequences derived from the nh2-terminal amino acid sequences determined for the etf subunits purified from w3a1 the screening of a partial genomic minilibrary containing size-selected bamhi-sali fragments using this probe identified a 22-kilobase pair insert containing the complete coding sequences for both w3a1 etf subunits the genes are arranged in tandem in the genomic dna with only 2 bases between the tag translation termination codon of the small subunit and the atg translation initiation codon of the large subunit the deduced amino acid sequences of each of the w3a1 etf subunits exhibit only approximately 30 identity with the corresponding subunits of the etf from human rat and paracoccus denitrificans which as a group are greater than 50 identical thus the etf from w3a1 may exhibit some unique structural features that like other differences in some of its physical and functional properties may distinguish this etf from others in this family a highly homologous region near the cooh terminus of the large subunit in all the etf proteins was found to contain a sequence that matches in several ways the adp-binding motif of flavoproteins and other dinucleotide-binding proteins suggesting that the large subunit forms a portion of the fad or amp binding site in these proteins under control of the tac promoter the cloned etf subunit genes were co-expressed in escherichia coli producing the heterodimeric holoprotein with physical spectral and electron-accepting properties essentially identical to the etf isolated from w3a1 the recombinant etf serves as the electron acceptor for w3a1 trimethylamine dehydrogenase in vitro accumulating as the air-stable anionic semiquinone in the presence of excess trimethylamine fully reduced etf could not be obtained even after prolonged enzymatic reduction
E,protection from copper toxicity in the bakers' yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae involves the action of a copper binding metallothionein encoded by the cup1 locus to identify additional factors contributing to copper ion homeostasis and detoxification we screened a genomic library for genes that confer high levels of copper resistance to yeast strains lacking cup1 this screen led to the identification of the crs5 copper-resistant suppressor gene by sequence analyses crs5 encodes a small molecular weight cysteine-rich protein with an amino acid sequence bearing all the features of a eukaryotic metallothionein the crs5 polypeptide exhibits a striking similarity to a number of mammalian and invertebrate metallothioneins yet shares surprisingly little homology with cup1 in yeast crs5 is expressed as a 05-kilobase mrna that is regulated both by copper ions and by oxidative stress and expression is dependent upon ace1 a copper and dna binding transcription factor also known to regulate cup1 deletion of the chromosomal crs5 locus was found to increase cellular sensitivity to copper but not cadmium toxicity these studies support an important role for the crs5 metallothionein-like protein in copper homeostasis and detoxification
B,the complete 2343479-bp genome sequence of the gram-negative pathogenic oral bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis strain w83 a major contributor to periodontal disease was determined whole-genome comparative analysis with other available complete genome sequences confirms the close relationship between the cytophaga-flavobacteria-bacteroides cfb phylum and the green-sulfur bacteria within the cfb phyla the genomes most similar to that of p gingivalis are those of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and b fragilis outside of the cfb phyla the most similar genome to p gingivalis is that of chlorobium tepidum supporting the previous phylogenetic studies that indicated that the chlorobia and cfb phyla are related albeit distantly genome analysis of strain w83 reveals a range of pathways and virulence determinants that relate to the novel biology of this oral pathogen among these determinants are at least six putative hemagglutinin-like genes and 36 previously unidentified peptidases genome analysis also reveals that p gingivalis can metabolize a range of amino acids and generate a number of metabolic end products that are toxic to the human host or human gingival tissue and contribute to the development of periodontal disease
B,the 4 202 353 bp genome of the alkaliphilic bacterium bacillus halodurans c-125 contains 4066 predicted protein coding sequences cdss 2141 527 of which have functional assignments 1182 29 of which are conserved cdss with unknown function and 743 18 3 of which have no match to any protein database among the total cdss 88 match sequences of proteins found only in bacillus subtilis and 667 are widely conserved in comparison with the proteins of various organisms including bsubtilis the b halodurans genome contains 112 transposase genes indicating that transposases have played an important evolutionary role in horizontal gene transfer and also in internal genetic rearrangement in the genome strain c-125 lacks some of the necessary genes for competence such as coms srfa and rapc supporting the fact that competence has not been demonstrated experimentally in c-125 there is no paralog of tupa encoding teichuronopeptide which contributes to alkaliphily in the c-125 genome and an ortholog of tupa cannot be found in the bsubtilis genome out of 11 sigma factors which belong to the extracytoplasmic function family 10 are unique to b halodurans suggesting that they may have a role in the special mechanism of adaptation to an alkaline environment
B,rickettsia conorii is an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes mediterranean spotted fever in humans we determined the 1268755-nucleotide complete genome sequence of r conorii containing 1374 open reading frames this genome exhibits 804 of the 834 genes of the previously determined r prowazekii genome plus 552 supplementary open reading frames and a 10-fold increase in the number of repetitive elements despite these differences the two genomes exhibit a nearly perfect colinearity that allowed the clear identification of different stages of gene alterations with gene remnants and 37 genes split in 105 fragments of which 59 are transcribed a 38-kilobase sequence inversion was dated shortly after the divergence of the genus
V,the nucleotide sequence of a 4379-bp-long dna segment located between map coordinates 765 and 892 in the ad3 genome was established the segment includes the entire early transcription unit 3 e3 and the 3'-part of the gene for the late polypeptide pviii the established sequence was compared to the sequence of the corresponding region in the ad2 genome hriss et al nucl acids res 8 1980 2173-2192 hriss and galibert nucl acids res 9 1981 1229-1249 although ad2 and ad3 belong to different serological and oncogenic subgroups their e3 regions are well conserved 55-60 homology in total the e3 region of ad3 appears to encode eight to nine different polypeptides many of which are likely to be membrane-associated the most conspicuous difference between the e3 regions of ad2 and ad3 is the presence of a 950-bp-long a  t-rich insert in the ad3 sequence this insert contains two open reading frames each encoding a polypeptide with a predicted mr of about 20000 the mrnas encoding these novel polypeptides were identified by s1 nuclease analysis
B,the nucleotide sequence has been determined of a 12368 base-pair region of dna cloned from the non-sulphur photosynthetic bacterium rhodopseudomonas blastica it contains a cluster of six genes of which five encode the subunits of f1-atpase the sixth codes for an unknown protein the genes are arranged in the same order as in the escherichia coli unc operon except that the unknown gene is placed between those for gamma and beta subunits neither the genes for f0 subunits nor a homologue of the e coli unci gene is associated with this locus the six genes are transcribed from a single promoter and we have designated this region the r blastica atp operon the two distal genes beta and epsilon may also be transcribed from a second promoter initiation and termination points for transcription have been identified by primer extensions and s1 nuclease mapping experiments signals involved in initiation of translation shine and dalgarno sequences and termination of transcription in the photosynthetic bacterium resemble those in e coli however no common features can be identified in these two bacteria between 5' regions adjacent to sites of initiation of transcription the sequence also contains a gene that encodes a protein homologous to discoidin a cell surface lectin of dictyostelium discoideum thought to be involved in cell--cell aggregation seven other reading frames have not been identified
E,peanut allergy is a significant health problem because of the frequency the potential severity and the chronicity of the allergic sensitivity serum ige from patients with documented peanut hypersensitivity reactions and a peanut cdna expression library were used to identify clones that encode peanut allergens one of the major peanut allergens ara h i was selected from these clones using ara h i specific oligonucleotides and polymerase chain reaction technology the ara h i clone identified a 23-kb mrna species on a northern blot containing peanut poly a rna dna sequence analysis of the cloned inserts revealed that the ara h i allergen has significant homology with the vicilin seed storage protein family found in most higher plants the isolation of the ara h i clones allowed the synthesis of this protein in e coli cells and subsequent recognition of this recombinant protein in immunoblot analysis using serum ige from patients with peanut hypersensitivity with the production of the recombinant peanut protein it will now be possible to address the pathophysiologic and immunologic mechanisms regarding peanut hypersensitivity reactions specifically and food hypersensitivity in general
B,listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen with a high mortality rate that has also emerged as a paradigm for intracellular parasitism we present and compare the genome sequences of l monocytogenes 2944528 base pairs and a nonpathogenic species l innocua 3011209 base pairs we found a large number of predicted genes encoding surface and secreted proteins transporters and transcriptional regulators consistent with the ability of both species to adapt to diverse environments the presence of 270 l monocytogenes and 149 l innocua strain-specific genes clustered in 100 and 63 islets respectively suggests that virulence in listeria results from multiple gene acquisition and deletion events
E,only a small proportion of the mouse genome is transcribed into mature messenger rna transcripts there is an international collaborative effort to identify all full-length mrna transcripts from the mouse and to ensure that each is represented in a physical collection of clones here we report the manual annotation of 60770 full-length mouse complementary dna sequences these are clustered into 33409 'transcriptional units' contributing 901 of a newly established mouse transcriptome database of these transcriptional units 4258 are new protein-coding and 11665 are new non-coding messages indicating that non-coding rna is a major component of the transcriptome 41 of all transcriptional units showed evidence of alternative splicing in protein-coding transcripts 79 of splice variations altered the protein product whole-transcriptome analyses resulted in the identification of 2431 sense-antisense pairs the present work completely supported by physical clones provides the most comprehensive survey of a mammalian transcriptome so far and is a valuable resource for functional genomics
B,helicobacter pylori one of the most common bacterial pathogens of humans colonizes the gastric mucosa where it appears to persist throughout the host's life unless the patient is treated colonization induces chronic gastric inflammation which can progress to a variety of diseases ranging in severity from superficial gastritis and peptic ulcer to gastric cancer and mucosal-associated lymphoma strain-specific genetic diversity has been proposed to be involved in the organism's ability to cause different diseases or even be beneficial to the infected host and to participate in the lifelong chronicity of infection here we compare the complete genomic sequences of two unrelated h pylori isolates this is to our knowledge the first such genomic comparison h pylori was believed to exhibit a large degree of genomic and allelic diversity but we find that the overall genomic organization gene order and predicted proteomes sets of proteins encoded by the genomes of the two strains are quite similar between 6 to 7 of the genes are specific to each strain with almost half of these genes being clustered in a single hypervariable region
E,a 24 kilobase cdna for rat mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase ec 2611 was isolated and sequenced the predicted presequence is 93 homologous to the presequences of the enzyme from pig and mouse the predicted amino acid sequence of the mature enzyme differs from that determined directly by amino acid sequencing huynh qk sakakibara r watanabe t and wada h 1981 j biochem tokyo 90 863-875 at 13 amino acids residues the most important difference is at position 140 where the cdna encodes a tryptophanyl residue rather than the previously reported glycine this critical residue is now seen to be conserved in all aspartate aminotransferases the coding region of this cdna was inserted into the plasmid cloning vector pkk233-2 and used to stably express an unfused precursor in escherichia coli jm105
B,we describe here the complete genome sequence 1111523 base pairs of the obligate intracellular parasite rickettsia prowazekii the causative agent of epidemic typhus this genome contains 834 protein-coding genes the functional profiles of these genes show similarities to those of mitochondrial genes no genes required for anaerobic glycolysis are found in either r prowazekii or mitochondrial genomes but a complete set of genes encoding components of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the respiratory-chain complex is found in r prowazekii in effect atp production in rickettsia is the same as that in mitochondria many genes involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of biosynthesis of amino acids and nucleosides in free-living bacteria are absent from r prowazekii and mitochondria such genes seem to have been replaced by homologues in the nuclear host genome the r prowazekii genome contains the highest proportion of non-coding dna 24 detected so far in a microbial genome such non-coding sequences may be degraded remnants of 'neutralized' genes that await elimination from the genome phylogenetic analyses indicate that r prowazekii is more closely related to mitochondria than is any other microbe studied so far
E,neuropeptides are synthesized as large precursor proteins that undergo posttranslational cleavages and modifications to produce bioactive peptides here we have cloned two closely related precursor proteins for the sea anemone neuropeptide antho-rfamide 60glu-gly-arg-phe-nh2 from anthopleura elegantissima the first precursor 435 amino acids long contains 13 copies of immature antho-rfamide gln-gly-arg-phe-gly and nine other antho-rfamide-related neuropeptide sequences that are in the c-terminal part of the protein the second precursor 429 amino acid residues harbors 14 copies of immature antho-rfamide and eight other related peptide sequences each copy of antho-rfamide or antho-rfamide-related peptide is followed at its c-terminal side by a single arg residue which is an established signal for posttranslational cleavage at the n terminus of each antho-rfamide sequence however basic residues are lacking and instead one or more acidic residues occur these acidic residues are the cleavage sites for a new type of processing enzyme occurring in neurons this enzyme could either be an amino- or endopeptidase hydrolyzing at the c-terminal side of asp or glu residues the n-terminal regions of the two precursor proteins harbor eight copies of the putative neuropeptide sequence pro-gln-phe-trp-lys-gly-arg-phe-ser and three additional closely related sequences the total number of all established and putative neuropeptides that may be cleaved from the precursors is 33 thus the antho-rfamide precursors beong to the most complex peptide precursor proteins known so far
E,spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 sca1 is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a cag trinucleotide repeat in this study we describe the identification and characterization of the gene harbouring this repeat the sca1 transcript is 10660 bases and is transcribed from both the wild type and sca1 alleles the cag repeat coding for a polyglutamine tract lies within the coding region the gene spans 450 kb of genomic dna and is organized in nine exons the first seven fall in the 5' untranslated region and the last two contain the coding region and a 7277 basepairs 3' untranslated region the first four non-coding exons undergo alternative splicing in several tissues these features suggest that the transcriptional and translational regulation of ataxin-1 the sca1 encoded protein may be complex
B,the groel gene of the alkaliphilic bacillus sp strain c-125 was cloned in escherichia coli and sequenced the groel gene encoded a polypeptide of 544 amino acids and was preceded by the incomplete groes gene lacking its 5'-end the sequence of the derived amino acids was 875 identical to that of b subtilis 854 identical to that of b stearothemophilus and 609 identical to that of e coli the groel protein was expressed in e coli purified groel protected yeast alpha-glucosidase from irreversible aggregation at a high temperature and the addition of mg-atp was essential for reactivation of the alpha-glucosidase the addition of e coli groes increased recovery of the enzyme activity indicating that c-125 groel could function in coordination with e coli groes
B,the genome of chlamydophila caviae formerly chlamydia psittaci gpic isolate 1 173 390 nt with a plasmid of 7966 nt was determined representing the fourth species with a complete genome sequence from the chlamydiaceae family of obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens of 1009 annotated genes 798 were conserved in all three other completed chlamydiaceae genomes the ccaviae genome contains 68 genes that lack orthologs in any other completed chlamydial genomes including tryptophan and thiamine biosynthesis determinants and a ribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase the product of the prsa gene notable amongst these was a novel member of the virulence-associated invasinintimin family iif of gram-negative bacteria intriguingly two authentic frameshift mutations in the orf indicate that this gene is not functional many of the unique genes are found in the replication termination region rtr or plasticity zone an area of frequent symmetrical inversion events around the replication terminus shown to be a hotspot for genome variation in previous genome sequencing studies in ccaviae the rtr includes several loci of particular interest including a large toxin gene and evidence of ancestral insertions of a bacteriophage this toxin gene not present in chlamydia pneumoniae is a member of the yopt effector family of type iii-secreted cysteine proteases one gene cluster guaba-add in the rtr is much more similar to orthologs in chlamydia muridarum than those in the phylogenetically closest species cpneumoniae suggesting the possibility of horizontal transfer of genes between the rodent-associated chlamydiae with most genes observed in the other chlamydial genomes represented ccaviae provides a good model for the chlamydiaceae and a point of comparison against the human atherosclerosis-associated cpneumoniae this crucial addition to the set of completed chlamydiaceae genome sequences is enabling dissection of the roles played by niche-specific genes in these important bacterial pathogens
E,angiogenesis is thought to depend on a precise balance of positive and negative regulation angiopoietin-1 ang1 is an angiogenic factor that signals through the endothelial cell-specific tie2 receptor tyrosine kinase like vascular endothelial growth factor ang1 is essential for normal vascular development in the mouse an ang1 relative termed angiopoietin-2 ang2 was identified by homology screening and shown to be a naturally occurring antagonist for ang1 and tie2 transgenic overexpression of ang2 disrupts blood vessel formation in the mouse embryo in adult mice and humans ang2 is expressed only at sites of vascular remodeling natural antagonists for vertebrate receptor tyrosine kinases are atypical thus the discovery of a negative regulator acting on tie2 emphasizes the need for exquisite regulation of this angiogenic receptor system
E,bcl-2 the prototypic cellular antiapoptotic gene decreases sindbis virus replication and sindbis virus-induced apoptosis in mouse brains resulting in protection against lethal encephalitis to investigate potential mechanisms by which bcl-2 protects against central nervous system sindbis virus infection we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify bcl-2-interacting gene products in an adult mouse brain library we identified a novel 60-kda coiled-coil protein beclin which we confirmed interacts with bcl-2 in mammalian cells using fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy to examine the role of beclin in sindbis virus pathogenesis we constructed recombinant sindbis virus chimeras that express full-length human beclin sinbeclin beclin lacking the putative bcl-2-binding domain sinbeclindeltabcl-2bd or beclin containing a premature stop codon near the 5' terminus sinbeclinstop the survival of mice infected with sinbeclin was significantly higher 71 than the survival of mice infected with sinbeclindeltabcl-2bd 9 or sinbeclinstop 7 p 60 0001 the brains of mice infected with sinbeclin had fewer sindbis virus rna-positive cells fewer apoptotic cells and lower viral titers than the brains of mice infected with sinbeclindeltabcl-2bd or sinbeclinstop these findings demonstrate that beclin is a novel bcl-2-interacting cellular protein that may play a role in antiviral host defense
B,we report the complete genome sequence of the model bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato dc3000 dc3000 which is pathogenic on tomato and arabidopsis thaliana the dc3000 genome 65 megabases contains a circular chromosome and two plasmids which collectively encode 5763 orfs we identified 298 established and putative virulence genes including several clusters of genes encoding 31 confirmed and 19 predicted type iii secretion system effector proteins many of the virulence genes were members of paralogous families and also were proximal to mobile elements which collectively comprise 7 of the dc3000 genome the bacterium possesses a large repertoire of transporters for the acquisition of nutrients particularly sugars as well as genes implicated in attachment to plant surfaces over 12 of the genes are dedicated to regulation which may reflect the need for rapid adaptation to the diverse environments encountered during epiphytic growth and pathogenesis comparative analyses confirmed a high degree of similarity with two sequenced pseudomonads pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas aeruginosa yet revealed 1159 genes unique to dc3000 of which 811 lack a known function
B,almost all aphid species homoptera insecta have 60-80 huge cells called bacteriocytes within which are round-shaped bacteria that are designated buchnera these bacteria are maternally transmitted to eggs and embryos through host generations and the mutualism between the host and the bacteria is so obligate that neither can reproduce independently buchnera is a close relative of escherichia coli but it contains more than 100 genomic copies per cell and its genome size is only a seventh of that of e coli here we report the complete genome sequence of buchnera sp strain aps which is composed of one 640681-base-pair chromosome and two small plasmids there are genes for the biosyntheses of amino acids essential for the hosts in the genome but those for non-essential amino acids are missing indicating complementarity and syntrophy between the host and the symbiont in addition buchnera lacks genes for the biosynthesis of cell-surface components including lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids regulator genes and genes involved in defence of the cell these results indicate that buchnera is completely symbiotic and viable only in its limited niche the bacteriocyte
B,colicin b formed by escherichia coli kills sensitive bacteria by dissipating the membrane potential through channel formation the nucleotide sequence of the structural gene cba which encodes colicin b and of the upstream region was determined a polypeptide consisting of 511 amino acids was deduced from the open reading frame the active colicin had a molecular weight of 54742 the carboxy-terminal amino acid sequence showed striking homology to the corresponding channel-forming region of colicin a of 216 amino acids 57 were identical and an additional 19 were homologous in this part 66 of the nucleotides were identical in the colicin a and b genes this region contained a sequence of 48 hydrophobic amino acids sequence homology to the other channel-forming colicins e1 and i was less pronounced a homologous pentapeptide was detected in colicins b m and i whose uptake required tonb protein function the same consensus sequence was found in all outer membrane proteins involved in the tonb-dependent uptake of iron siderophores and of vitamin b12 upstream of cba a sequence comprising 294 nucleotides was identical to the sequence upstream of the structural gene of colicin e1 with the exception of 43 single-nucleotide replacements additions or deletions apparently the region upstream of colicins b and e1 and the channel-forming sequences of colicins a and b have a common origin
E,a genetic selection method was developed for the cloning of positive-acting transcriptional regulatory genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae the method was applied for the isolation of activators of trichoderma reesei hypocrea jecorina cellulase genes activator genes were isolated from a t reesei expression cdna library on the basis of the ability of their translation products to activate transcription from the full-length t reesei cbh1 promoter coupled to the s cerevisiae his3 gene and to support the growth of the yeast colonies in the absence of histidine among the clones obtained was the ace1 gene encoding a novel polypeptide acei that contains three zinc finger motifs of cys2-his2 type possible acei homologues were found among expressed sequence tags of aspergillus and neurospora the ability of acei to bind to the cbh1 promoter was further confirmed in the yeast one-hybrid system in vitro binding and gel mobility shift assays revealed several binding sites for the acei protein in the cbh1 promoter disruption of the ace1 gene in t reesei resulted in retarded growth of the fungus on a cellulose-containing medium on which cellulases are normally highly expressed
B,the 2160837-base pair genome sequence of an isolate of streptococcus pneumoniae a gram-positive pathogen that causes pneumonia bacteremia meningitis and otitis media contains 2236 predicted coding regions of these 1440 64 were assigned a biological role approximately 5 of the genome is composed of insertion sequences that may contribute to genome rearrangements through uptake of foreign dna extracellular enzyme systems for the metabolism of polysaccharides and hexosamines provide a substantial source of carbon and nitrogen for s pneumoniae and also damage host tissues and facilitate colonization a motif identified within the signal peptide of proteins is potentially involved in targeting these proteins to the cell surface of low-guaninecytosine gc gram-positive species several surface-exposed proteins that may serve as potential vaccine candidates were identified comparative genome hybridization with dna arrays revealed strain differences in s pneumoniae that could contribute to differences in virulence and antigenicity
B,haemolysins are membrane-damaging agents which have been described as bacterial virulence factors due to their ability to lyse erythrocytes and other host cells and therefore inducing a greater inflammatory response elliott et al 1998 pasteurella multocida was found to be haemolytic under anaerobic conditions in this study we cloned and characterised a p multocida gene designated ahpa which conferred a haemolytic phenotype on escherichia coli when incubated under anaerobic conditions a deletion was introduced into the ahpa open reading frame which abolished the haemolytic phenotype the clone containing ahpa showed erythrocyte specificity causing haemolysis of bovine and equine erythrocytes and demonstrated weak haemolysis on ovine erythrocytes upon further investigation ahpa was found to affect the expression of the e coli k-12 latent haemolysin shea under anaerobic conditions
B,background vibrio parahaemolyticus a gram-negative marine bacterium is a worldwide cause of food-borne gastroenteritis v parahaemolyticus strains of a few specific serotypes probably derived from a common clonal ancestor have lately caused a pandemic of gastroenteritis the organism is phylogenetically close to v cholerae the causative agent of cholera methods the whole genome sequence of a clinical v parahaemolyticus strain rimd2210633 was established by shotgun sequencing the coding sequences were identified by use of gambler and glimmer programs comparative analysis with the v cholerae genome was undertaken with mummer findings the genome consisted of two circular chromosomes of 3288558 bp and 1877212 bp it contained 4832 genes comparison of the v parahaemolyticus genome with that of v cholerae showed many rearrangements within and between the two chromosomes genes for the type iii secretion system ttss were identified in the genome of v parahaemolyticus v cholerae does not have these genes interpretation the ttss is a central virulence factor of diarrhoea-causing bacteria such as shigella salmonella and enteropathogenic escherichia coli which cause gastroenteritis by invading or intimately interacting with intestinal epithelial cells our results suggest that v parahaemolyticus and v cholerae use distinct mechanisms to establish infection this finding explains clinical features of v parahaemolyticus infections which commonly include inflammatory diarrhoea and in some cases systemic manifestations such as septicaemia distinct from those of v cholerae infections which are generally associated with non-inflammatory diarrhoea
B,the lactose-protease plasmid pucl22 of lactococcus lactis subsp lactis strain cnrz270 contained two inverted copies of is 1076 flanking a region of 37 kb this internal region was sequenced and found to contain two large open reading frames orf1 and orfp in opposite orientations orf1 consists of 2289 bp the deduced 763-amino-acid sequence is similar to the atpases of the clpa family it contains two well-conserved consensus atp-binding sites it was named clpl orfp consists of 930 bp encoding a protein of 310 amino acids no similarity with any known protein was found in genbank data for orfp increased atp-dependent proteolytic activity was detected in extracts from escherichia coli cells expressing the clpl and orfp genes
E,the cadherins are a family of calcium-binding membrane glycoproteins most cadherins are capable of acting as cell adhesion molecules cams in order to begin a thorough analysis of the roles of these cams in the testis we employed a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr strategy to identify the cadherins expressed in this tissue at various stages of development oligonucleotides encoding amino acid sequences that are conserved among all of the known cadherins were used as primers in the rt-pcr with cdna preparations of fetal newborn 7-day 21-day and adult mouse testes employed as templates the pcr products were subcloned into a plasmid vector and sequenced on the basis of the nucleotide sequences of these pcr products we have determined that five previously characterized cadherins e-cadherin n-cadherin p-cadherin k-cadherin and ob-cadherin as well as two novel cadherins t1-cadherin and t2-cadherin are expressed at various stages during testicular development in order to determine the expression patterns of these cadherins we ascertained the mrna levels of each cadherin normalized to the levels of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase mrna in fetal newborn 7-day 21-day and adult mouse testes we observed that n-cadherin mrna is expressed at all stages of testicular development with maximal levels being present in the testes of 21-day-old mice furthermore we found that e- p- k- ob- and t2-cadherin mrnas are all expressed in the fetal gonad the testicular levels of these cadherin mrnas decreased dramatically after birth conversely t1-cadherin mrna was not detected in the fetal newborn and 7-day-old testes but was present in 21-day-old and adult testes t1-cadherin levels were 10-fold higher in the testes of adult mice compared to the levels found in the testes of 21-day-old mice we speculate that these cadherins will be found to be intimately involved in mediating cell interactions during testicular development
E,beta2-adrenergic receptors were detected in bovine oviductal epithelium by use of receptor binding studies and expression analysis complementary dna cloning gave use to the first full-length bovine beta2-adrenoceptor messenger rna sequence 2030 bases receptor bioactivity in oviduct epithelial cells was characterized by specific ligand interaction and consequent camp generation expression studies demonstrated an estrous cycle-dependent regulation with higher transcript levels and significantly increased binding capacity during the luteal phase after progesterone supplementation oviduct epithelial cells showed elevated receptor expression in culture supporting the hypothesis that progesterone up-regulates the beta2-adrenergic receptor within these cells it seems likely that catecholamines from the circulation or from innervation might be able to influence reproductive success by regulating oviductal secretion
E,urea-extractable proteins have been purified from the cephalothoracic cuticle of mature araneus diadematus spiders two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed at least 12 major proteins with pis between 45 and 85 five proteins were purified and their primary structure determined using a combination of mass spectrometry and edman degradation based on the amino acid sequence the proteins can be divided into two groups both characterized by hydrophobic regions dominated by ala pro and val sequence similarity was observed between all the spider cuticle proteins and a number of proteins from other arthropod cuticles although the similarity seemed to be confined only to a region in the central part of the molecules it does link these very distantly related species
B,two proteins component i ci and component ii cii catalyze the biotransformation of crotonobetaine to l--carnitine in proteus sp ci was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from cell-free extracts of proteus sp the n-terminal amino acid sequence of ci showed high similarity 80 to the caib gene product from escherichia coli o44k74 which encodes the l--carnitine dehydratase ci alone was unable to convert crotonobetaine into l--carnitine even in the presence of the cosubstrates crotonobetainyl-coa or gamma-butyrobetainyl-coa which are essential for this biotransformation the relative molecular mass of ci was determined to be 911 kda ci is composed of two identical subunits of molecular mass 436 kda the isoelectric point is 50 cii was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from cell-free extracts of proteus sp and its n-terminal amino acid sequence showed high similarity 75 to the caid gene product of e coli o44k74 the relative molecular mass of cii was shown to be 880 kda and cii is composed of three identical subunits of molecular mass 301 kda the isoelectric point of cii is 49 for the biotransformation of crotonobetaine to l--carnitine the presence of ci cii and a cosubstrate crotonobetainyl-coa or gamma-butyrobetainyl-coa were shown to be essential
B,the pheromone n-3-oxohexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone ohhl regulates expression of bioluminescence in the marine bacterium vibrio fischeri the production of carbapenem antibiotic in erwinia carotovora and exoenzymes in both e carotovora and pseudomonas aeruginosa a characteristic feature of this regulatory mechanism in v fischeri is that it is cell density-dependent reflecting the need to accumulate sufficient pheromone to trigger the induction of gene expression using a lux plasmid-based bioluminescent sensor for ohhl pheromone production by e carotovora enterobacter agglomerans hafnia alvei rahnella aquatilis and serratia marcescens has been demonstrated and shown also to be cell density-dependent production of ohhl implies the presence in these bacteria of a gene equivalent to luxi chromosomal banks from all five enteric bacteria have yielded clones capable of eliciting ohhl production when expressed in escherichia coli the luxi homologue from both e carotovora cari and e agglomerans eagi were characterized at the dna sequence level and the deduced protein sequences have only 25 identity with the v fischeri luxi despite this cari eagi and luxi are shown to be biologically equivalent an insertion mutant of eagi demonstrates that this gene is essential for ohhl production in e agglomerans
B,the 2160267 bp genome sequence of streptococcus agalactiae the leading cause of bacterial sepsis pneumonia and meningitis in neonates in the us and europe is predicted to encode 2175 genes genome comparisons among s agalactiae streptococcus pneumoniae streptococcus pyogenes and the other completely sequenced genomes identified genes specific to the streptococci and to s agalactiae these in silico analyses combined with comparative genome hybridization experiments between the sequenced serotype v strain 2603 vr and 19 s agalactiae strains from several serotypes using whole-genome microarrays revealed the genetic heterogeneity among s agalactiae strains even of the same serotype and provided insights into the evolution of virulence mechanisms
E,the capacity to initiate dna replication appears during oocyte maturation in xenopus initiation of s phase is driven by several components which include active cyclincdk complexes we have identified three xenopus cyclin e clones showing 59 amino acid identity with human cyclin e the recruitment of cyclin e mrna like cdk2 mrna into the polysomal fraction during oocyte maturation results in the accumulation of the corresponding proteins in unfertilized eggs cyclin e mrna remains polyadenylated during cleavage and anti-cyclin e antibodies detect xlcyclin e in embryonic nuclei at this time cdk2 protein is necessary for the phosphorylation of radiolabelled cyclin e added to egg extracts radiolabelled xlcyclin e enters interphase nuclei and though stable through interphase and mitosis is not associated with condensed mitotic chromatin in egg extracts endogenous xlcyclin e rapidly associates with nuclei before s phase and remains nuclear throughout interphase becoming nucleoplasmic in g2prophase under conditions where initiation of replication is limiting in extracts xlcyclin e associates only with those nuclei that undergo s phase these features are entirely consistent with the view that xlcyclin e is required for initiation of s phase
E,gamma-crystallin is the major and most abundant lens protein present in the eye lens of lower vertebrates such as amphibian and piscine species to facilitate structural characterization of gamma-crystallins isolated from the lens of the bullfrog rana catesbeiana a cdna mixture was synthesized from the polyamrna isolated from fresh eye lenses cdna encoding gamma-crystallin was then amplified using polymerase chain reaction pcr based on two primers designed according to the relatively conserved n- and c-terminal sequences of known gamma-crystallins from teleostean fishes pcr-amplified product corresponding to gamma-crystallin isoforms was obtained which was then subcloned in puc18 vector and transformed into escherichia coli strain jm109 plasmids containing amplified gamma-crystallin cdnas were purified and prepared for nucleotide sequencing by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method sequencing several clones containing dna inserts of about 054 kb revealed the presence of two isoforms with an open reading frame of 534 base pairs covering two gamma-crystallins each with a deduced protein sequence of 177 amino acids including the translation-initiating methionine these gamma-crystallins of pi 6364 and 6366 contain a low-methionine content of 281 in contrast to 11-16 obtained for those gamma-crystallins with high-methionine content from most teleostean lenses pairwise sequence comparison of bullfrog gamma-crystallins with those published sequences of gamma-crystallins from carp shark xenopus and another rana frog bovine and human lenses indicates that there is only 46-63 sequence similarity among these species revealing that amphibians possess a very complex and heterogeneous group of gamma-crystallins even from closely related species of rana frogs the sequence analysis and comparison of various isoforms of the frog gamma-crystallin family provide a firm basis for identifying these lens proteins as members of a multigene family more complex than that reported for mammalian gamma-crystallins
E,a cdna clone pcm12 of the chalcone synthase chs of matthiola incana r br brassicaceae was isolated from a cdna library sequenced and analysed it comprises the complete coding sequence for the chs and 5' and 3' untranslated regions the deduced amino acid sequence shows that the matthiola incana chs consists of 394 amino acid residues comparison with chs amino acid sequences of other plants indicates more than 82 homology
E,we have sequenced and annotated the genome of fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe which contains the smallest number of protein-coding genes yet recorded for a eukaryote 4824 the centromeres are between 35 and 110 kilobases kb and contain related repeats including a highly conserved 18-kb element regions upstream of genes are longer than in budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae possibly reflecting more-extended control regions some 43 of the genes contain introns of which there are 4730 fifty genes have significant similarity with human disease genes half of these are cancer related we identify highly conserved genes important for eukaryotic cell organization including those required for the cytoskeleton compartmentation cell-cycle control proteolysis protein phosphorylation and rna splicing these genes may have originated with the appearance of eukaryotic life few similarly conserved genes that are important for multicellular organization were identified suggesting that the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes required more new genes than did the transition from unicellular to multicellular organization
E,a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis database of dog canis familiaris proteins is presented the database contains 1212 protein spots which have been characterised in terms of their pi and mr this database has been integrated into the hsc-2dpage database which is accessible on the internet via the world wide web with the uniform resource location url httpwwwharefieldnthamesnhsuknhli proteinindexhtml identifications for 80 of the protein spots have been obtained by visual cross-matching with the human heart protein database in hsc-2dpage 42 spots n-terminal microsequence analysis 25 spots and peptide mass fingerprinting 20 spots this database is being used in studies of alterations in protein expression in models of heart failure and heart disease
B,the genome sequence of the solvent-producing bacterium clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 has been determined by the shotgun approach the genome consists of a 394-mb chromosome and a 192-kb megaplasmid that contains the majority of genes responsible for solvent production comparison of c acetobutylicum to bacillus subtilis reveals significant local conservation of gene order which has not been seen in comparisons of other genomes with similar or in some cases closer phylogenetic proximity this conservation allows the prediction of many previously undetected operons in both bacteria however the c acetobutylicum genome also contains a significant number of predicted operons that are shared with distantly related bacteria and archaea but not with b subtilis phylogenetic analysis is compatible with the dissemination of such operons by horizontal transfer the enzymes of the solventogenesis pathway and of the cellulosome of c acetobutylicum comprise a new set of metabolic capacities not previously represented in the collection of complete genomes these enzymes show a complex pattern of evolutionary affinities emphasizing the role of lateral gene exchange in the evolution of the unique metabolic profile of the bacterium many of the sporulation genes identified in b subtilis are missing in c acetobutylicum which suggests major differences in the sporulation process thus comparative analysis reveals both significant conservation of the genome organization and pronounced differences in many systems that reflect unique adaptive strategies of the two gram-positive bacteria
E,using a yeast interaction screen to search for proteins that interact with cyclin d1-cdk4 we identified a 27 kda mouse protein related to the p21 cyclin-cdk inhibitor p27 interacts strongly with d-type cyclins and cdk4 in vitro and more weakly with cyclin e and cdk2 in mouse fibroblasts p27 is associated predominantly with cyclin d1-cdk4 recombinant p27 is a potent inhibitor of cyclin d1-cdk4 and cyclin a-cdk2 protein kinase activity and a weaker inhibitor of cyclin b1-cdc2 overexpression of p27 in saos-2 cells causes g1 arrest p27 protein levels do not change as serum-stimulated quiescent mouse fibroblasts progress through the cell cycle p27 is identical to p27kip1 a cyclin-cdk inhibitor present in tgf beta-treated cells p27 has the hallmarks of a negative regulator of g1 progression and may mediate tgf beta-induced g1 arrest
B,in the cyanobacterium synechococcus sp strain pcc 7942 a multigene family of three different isozymes encodes the proteolytic subunit clpp of the atp-dependent clp protease in contrast to the monocistronic clppi gene clppii and clppiii are part of two bicistronic operons with clpx and clpr respectively unlike most bacterial clp proteins the synechococcus clpp2 clpp3 clpr and clpx proteins were not highly inducible by high temperatures or by other stresses such as cold high light or oxidation although slower gradual rises occurred for all four proteins during high light and for clpp3 clpr and clpx at low temperature attempts to inactivate the clppii clpiii clpr or clpx genes were only successful for clppii suggesting the others are essential for synechococcus cell viability the deltaclppii mutant exhibited no significant phenotypic changes from the wild-type including no change in clpx content despite the apparent bicistronic arrangement of both clppii-clpx and clpr-clppiii all four genes primarily produce monocistronic transcripts although polycistronic transcripts were detected mapping of 5' ends for the clpx and clppiii monocistronic transcripts revealed promoters situated within the 3' region of clppii and clpr respectively transcriptional and translational studies further showed differences in the expression and regulation between the clpp-clpr-clpx genes inactivation of clppi caused a significant decrease in clpp2 protein concomitant to small increases in both clpp3 and clpr inactivation of clppii resulted in a large rise in clppi transcripts but to a lesser extent in clpp1 protein similar small increases in clpp3 clpr and clpx proteins also occurred in deltaclppii these results highlight the regulatory complexity of these multiple clp genes and their functional importance in cyanobacteria
E,we have identified three novel rarely expressed human genes that encode new members of the lipid transferlipopolysaccharide binding protein ltlbp gene family based on sequence homology bpi and other members of the ltlbp family are structurally related proteins capable of binding phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides real-time pcr studies indicate that bpil1 and bpil3 are highly expressed in hypertrophic tonsils in situ hybridization analysis of bpil2 shows prominent expression in skin specimens from psoriasis patients bpil1 and bpil3 map to chromosome 20q11 thus these novel genes form a cluster with bpi and two other members of the ltlbp gene family on the long arm of human chr 20 bpil2maps to chr 22q13 the exonintron organization of all three genes is highly conserved with that of bpi suggesting evolution from a common ancestor
E,porcine bm88 is a neuron-specific protein that enhances neuroblastoma cell differentiation in vitro and may be involved in neuronal differentiation in vivo here we report the identification by western blotting of homologous proteins in human and mouse brain and the isolation of their respective cdnas several human and mouse clones were identified in the est database using porcine bm88 cdna as a query a human and a mouse est clone were chosen for sequencing and were found both to predict a protein of 149 amino acids with 799 reciprocal identity and 764 and 707 identities to the porcine protein respectively this indicated that the clones corresponded to the human and mouse bm88 homologues in vitro expression in a cell-free system as well as transient expression in cos7 cells yielded polypeptide products that were recognized by anti-bm88 antibodies and were identical in size to the native bm88 protein northern-blot analysis showed a wide distribution of the gene in human brain whereas immunohistochemistry on human brain sections demonstrated that the expression of bm88 is confined to neurons the initial mapping assignment of human bm88 to chromosome 11p155 a region implicated in beckwith-wiedemann syndrome and tumorigenesis was retrieved from the unigene database maintained at the national centre for biotechnology information ncbi bethesda md usa we confirmed this localization by performing fluorescence in situ hybridization on bm88-positive cosmid clones isolated from a human genomic library these results suggest that bm88 may be a candidate gene for genetic disorders associated with alterations at 11p155
E,transcription factors containing a conserved dna-binding domain similar to that of the proto-oncogene c-myb have been identified in nearly all eukaryotes myb-related proteins from plants generally contain two related helix-turn-helix motifs the r2 and r3 repeats it was estimated that arabidopsis thaliana contains more than 100 r2r3-myb genes the few cases where functional data are available suggest an important role of these genes in the regulation of secondary metabolism the control of cell shape disease resistance and hormone responses to determine the full regulatory potential of this large family of regulatory genes a systematic search for the function of all genes of this family was initiated sequence data for more than 90 different a thaliana r2r3-myb genes have been obtained sequence comparison revealed conserved amino acid motifs shared by subgroups of r2r3-myb genes in addition to the characteristic dna-binding domain no significant clustering of the genes was detected although they are not uniformly distributed throughout the a thaliana genome
B,staphylococcus epidermidis strains are diverse in their pathogenicity some are invasive and cause serious nosocomial infections whereas others are non-pathogenic commensal organisms to analyse the implications of different virulence factors in staphylococcus epidermidis infections the complete genome of staphylococcus epidermidis strain atcc 12228 a non-biofilm forming non-infection associated strain used for detection of residual antibiotics in food products was sequenced this strain showed low virulence by mouse and rat experimental infections the genome consists of a single 2499 279 bp chromosome and six plasmids the chromosomal g  c content is 321 and 2419 protein coding sequences cds are predicted among which 230 are putative novel genes compared to the virulence factors in staphylococcus aureus aside from delta-haemolysin and beta-haemolysin other toxin genes were not found in contrast the majority of adhesin genes are intact in atcc 12228 most strikingly the ica operon coding for the enzymes synthesizing interbacterial cellular polysaccharide is missing in atcc 12228 and rearrangements of adjacent genes are shown no mec genes is256 is257 were found in atcc 12228 it is suggested that the absence of the ica operon is a genetic marker in commensal staphylococcus epidermidis strains which are less likely to become invasive
E,molecular cloning of cholecystokinin cck mrna from porcine brain and gut has demonstrated that cck is synthesized as an identical precursor in both tissues the sequence for porcine cck-58 predicted from cck cdna was identical with the amino acid sequence of the peptide purified from different lots of animals however one group did report that there were differences in the n-terminus of cck-58 purified from the intestines of two different lots of mongrel dogs in the current report it is demonstrated that the amino acid sequences of cck-58 purified separately from three bovine brains are identical through the first 19 n-terminal amino acid residues the peptides were sequenced for ten additional steps and were shown to be identical with the previously reported sequences for the n-terminus of cck-39 the n-terminus of bovine cck-58 has the following sequence avprvddepraqlgallar
E,we have cloned and sequenced the plastid atpase operons atp1 and atp2 and flanking regions from the unicellular red alga galdieria sulphuraria cyanidium caldarium six genes 5 atpi h g f d and a 3 are linked in atp1 encoding atpase subunits a c b b delta and alpha respectively the atpf gene does not contain an intron and overlaps atpd by 1 bp as in the genome of chloroplasts from land plants the cluster is located downstream of rps2 but between this gene and atp1 we found the gene for the prokaryotic translation elongation factor ts downstream of atpa we detected two open reading frames one encoding a putative transport protein the genes atpb and atpe encoding atpase subunits beta and epsilon respectively are linked in atp2 separated by a 2 bp spacer upstream of atpb an uninterrupted orf167 was detected which is homologous to an intron-containing open reading frame in land plant chloroplasts this orf167 is preceded on the opposite dna strand by a homologue to initiation factor 2 in prokaryotes the arrangement of atp1 and atp2 is the same as observed in the multicellular red alga antithamnion sp indicating a conserved genome arrangement in the red algal plastid genome differences compared to green chloroplast genomes suggest a large phylogenetic distance between red algae and green plants while similarities in arrangement and sequence to chromophytic atpase operons support a red algal origin of chlorophyll ac-containing plastids or alternatively point to a common prokaryotic endosymbiont
B,the components of the fibronectin-binding antigen 85 complex 85a 85b and 85c and the related protein mpbmpt51 are major secreted proteins in mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium bovis bcg the fbpa fbpc and mpt51 genes encoding 85a 85c and mpt51 respectively were isolated from mycobacterium avium and sequenced in this study the structures of these genes and that of the fbpb gene encoding the 85b protein were conserved in these three species the secreted amounts of 85a 85b 85c and mpbmpt51 were compared for m tuberculosis bcg and m avium these four proteins were found in large amounts in the culture filtrates from m tuberculosis and bcg in contrast in the culture filtrate from m avium 85b and mpt51 were abundant whereas 85a and 85c were hardly found in spite of the presence of the encoding genes the difference in the secretion amounts might be regulated at the transcription level these facts might reflect host immunopathogenesis the protective immunities against infections and the drug susceptibilities of these organisms
E,the exon-intron organization of two rabbit genes that hybridize with cytochrome p-450 3a p-450alc cdna has been determined by restriction mapping and sequence analysis gene 1 encodes cytochrome p-450 3a as judged by the complete identity of its coding nucleotide sequence with p-450 3a cdna gene 2 encodes a previously uncharacterized cytochrome p-450 that is 97 identical in primary structure to p-450 3a with 16 amino acid differences scattered throughout the protein genes 1 and 2 which are 10 and 9 kilobases in length respectively are comprised of 9 exons with exon-intron junctions occurring at identical positions along the mrna sequences each gene contains two transcription start sites approximately 27 and 33 nucleotides upstream from the translation initiation codon as determined by primer extension and s1 nuclease protection experiments the predicted lengths of gene 1 and 2 transcripts from the first transcription start site to the polya attachment site are 1999 and 1660 nucleotides respectively this difference in size is primarily the result of a 338-base pair deletion in the 3' nontranslated portion of the gene 2 transcript relative to that of gene 1 the two genes show considerable similarity in their 5' flanking regions including a tataa transcriptional promoter element at position -28 however a 32-base pair element that is repeated in gene 1 is present only as a single inexact copy in gene 2 by use of synthetic oligonucleotides as hybridization probes gene 2 transcripts were shown to be present in polya rna from untreated rabbit liver at approximately 50 of p-450 3a mrna levels in kidney however no gene 2 mrna was detected although 3a mrna was present at approximately 10 of the level in liver
E,a variety of stimuli have been identified which initiate transcription-dependent programmed cell death apoptosis in specific target cells since the withdrawal of androgens induces regression and apoptosis in rat ventral prostate rvp epithelial cells and it is known that the androgen receptor is a transcriptional regulator we used subtraction cdna cloning to isolate differentially expressed transcripts from the rvp of androgen ablated rats in addition to sulfated glycoprotein-2 and glutathione s-transferase gst which had been previously described several other transcripts were found to be elevated 3- to 8-fold in the regressing rvp dna sequencing revealed that two of these cdna clones encode matrix carboxyglutamic acid and gamma-actin respectively a third cdna contained novel sequence information and was named rvp1 the rvp1 transcript is expressed at very low levels in the rvp and epididymis of normal adult rats less than 001 of the total mrna and is undetectable in other tissues such as kidney liver and muscle rvp1 encodes a putative 280-amino acid protein which shares no significant homology with previously described protein functional domains we examined the expression of these transcripts in serum-starved nih 3t3 cells to determine whether any of them are elevated in cells that are growth arrested it was found that only gst mrna levels are increased under these conditions these data may suggest that induction of some genes such as rvp1 could be associated with apoptosis whereas other transcripts such as gst may be up-regulated in response to altered rates of cellular metabolism
E,nineteen p1 and tac clones which have been mapped on the fine physical map of the arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 5 were sequenced according to the shotgun-based strategy and their structural features were analysed the total length of the regions sequenced in this study was 1367185 bp combining this with the regions covered by 90 p1 and tac clones previously reported the total length of chromosome 5 sequenced to date becomes 8058855 bp on the basis of similarity search against protein and est databases and gene modeling with computer programs a total of 330 potential protein-coding regions were identified bringing an average density of the genes to approximately one gene per 41 kb introns were identified in 810 of the potential protein genes for which the entire gene structure was predicted with an average number per gene of 42 and an average length of the introns of 180 bp the rna-coding genes identified were 9 trna genes corresponding to 8 amino acid species and 2 genes for u2 nuclear rna these sequence features are essentially identical to those in the previously reported sequences the sequence data and gene information are available on the world wide web database kaos kazusa arabidopsis data opening site at httpwwwkazusaorjparabi
E,dna from a rat hippocampus cdna library and sets of highly degenerate oligonucleotide primers directed toward conserved regions of previously cloned g-protein receptors were used in the polymerase chain reaction to selectively amplify and clone new members of this gene family a human hippocampus cdna library was screened with a 610 base pair fragment generated by pcr and a cdna clone h3183 was isolated the deduced amino acid sequence of this clone encoded a protein of 501 amino acids that showed strong sequence homology to previously cloned g-protein receptors nucleotide sequence analysis revealed clone h3183 was 78 homologous to a rat alpha 1a adrenergic receptor with homology being 95 when comparisons were made in the region that lies between the first to the seventh transmembrane domains based on this high degree of sequence homology we conclude that clone h3183 represents a cdna for a human alpha 1a adrenergic receptor
E,the fly drosophila melanogaster is one of the most intensively studied organisms in biology and serves as a model system for the investigation of many developmental and cellular processes common to higher eukaryotes including humans we have determined the nucleotide sequence of nearly all of the approximately 120-megabase euchromatic portion of the drosophila genome using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy supported by extensive clone-based sequence and a high-quality bacterial artificial chromosome physical map efforts are under way to close the remaining gaps however the sequence is of sufficient accuracy and contiguity to be declared substantially complete and to support an initial analysis of genome structure and preliminary gene annotation and interpretation the genome encodes approximately 13600 genes somewhat fewer than the smaller caenorhabditis elegans genome but with comparable functional diversity
V,the alt gene product is a component of the t4 phage head upon infection of the host cell approximately 40 copies of the alt protein enter the cell together with the viral dna molecule the alt protein then adp-ribosylates one of the two alpha-subunits of host rna polymerase a restriction fragment harboring the adp-ribosyltransferase gene of bacteriophage t4 was cloned into the plasmid vector pbluescript the nucleotide sequence was determined and the reading frame was identified two m13 clone libraries established with dna isolated from bacteriophages t2 and t6 then were screened for the corresponding genes the nucleotide sequences of the three alt genes and the deduced amino acid sequences were compared secondary structure predictions and nad-binding studies resulted in the location of the substrate-binding site in the nh2-terminal regions of the enzymes
B,the genus xanthomonas is a diverse and economically important group of bacterial phytopathogens belonging to the gamma-subdivision of the proteobacteria xanthomonas axonopodis pv citri xac causes citrus canker which affects most commercial citrus cultivars resulting in significant losses worldwide symptoms include canker lesions leading to abscission of fruit and leaves and general tree decline xanthomonas campestris pv campestris xcc causes black rot which affects crucifers such as brassica and arabidopsis symptoms include marginal leaf chlorosis and darkening of vascular tissue accompanied by extensive wilting and necrosis xanthomonas campestris pv campestris is grown commercially to produce the exopolysaccharide xanthan gum which is used as a viscosifying and stabilizing agent in many industries here we report and compare the complete genome sequences of xac and xcc their distinct disease phenotypes and host ranges belie a high degree of similarity at the genomic level more than 80 of genes are shared and gene order is conserved along most of their respective chromosomes we identified several groups of strain-specific genes and on the basis of these groups we propose mechanisms that may explain the differing host specificities and pathogenic processes
B,the 4 202 353 bp genome of the alkaliphilic bacterium bacillus halodurans c-125 contains 4066 predicted protein coding sequences cdss 2141 527 of which have functional assignments 1182 29 of which are conserved cdss with unknown function and 743 18 3 of which have no match to any protein database among the total cdss 88 match sequences of proteins found only in bacillus subtilis and 667 are widely conserved in comparison with the proteins of various organisms including bsubtilis the b halodurans genome contains 112 transposase genes indicating that transposases have played an important evolutionary role in horizontal gene transfer and also in internal genetic rearrangement in the genome strain c-125 lacks some of the necessary genes for competence such as coms srfa and rapc supporting the fact that competence has not been demonstrated experimentally in c-125 there is no paralog of tupa encoding teichuronopeptide which contributes to alkaliphily in the c-125 genome and an ortholog of tupa cannot be found in the bsubtilis genome out of 11 sigma factors which belong to the extracytoplasmic function family 10 are unique to b halodurans suggesting that they may have a role in the special mechanism of adaptation to an alkaline environment
B,we determined a 146 kb contiguous sequence at the 25 degrees-36 degrees region of the bacillus subtilis chromosome containing the amye-srfa segment among the 113 orfs identified 33 are already known functions were assigned to 38 orfs by a search of non-redundant protein sequence data banks and those of 16 orfs were suggested through significant similarity with reported sequences the amino acid sequences of 13 of the orfs were similar to proteins of unknown function of escherichia coli haemophilus influenzae and other species we did not find similarities for 29 orfs to any known proteins the 146 kb region is rich in enzymes 35 orfs related to the metabolism of low molecular mass compounds and five genes for surfactin production occupy about 26 kb of the region
B,klebsiella sp lf 1202 was isolated as a bacterium that can assimilate adenosine as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen f ling et al agric biol chem 55 573-575 1991 from a soil sample both the purine nucleoside phosphorylase pnpase and uridine phosphorylase upase of this bacterium were induced simultaneously when the bacterium was cultured in a medium containing adenosine or uridine as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen this induction profile is different from that of escherichia coli here we cloned and sequenced the gene corresponding to each enzyme the open reading frame orf of the pnpase gene consisted of 717 bp that encoded a polypeptide of 239 amino acids with a molecular weight of 26198 the orf of the upase gene consisted of 834 bp that encoded a polypeptide of 278 amino acids with a molecular weight of 28912
E,the dif-1 gene was identified in a general screen for maternal-effect embryonic lethal mel mutants dif-1 mutant embryos complete gastrulation and embryonic cell division normally but then arrest development with only a small amount of tissue differentiation either maternal or zygotic dif-1 activity is sufficient for wild-type development the temperature-sensitive period of a cold-sensitive dif-1 mutant shows that dif-1 activity is essential only for 3 h corresponding to the major period of embryonic tissue differentiation and is not required post-embryonically the results point to a role for dif-1 in the maintenance of tissue differentiation in the developing embryo but not for its initiation cloning and sequencing of the dif-1 gene revealed that its product is homologous to proteins in the mitochondrial carrier family although dif-1 activity is required only during embryogenesis dif-1 rna is expressed at all stages of development in situ hybridization to embryos showed that dif-1 rna is initially present in all cells of the embryo this most likely corresponds to maternal dif-1 rna later the presumable zygotic dif-1 rna is found only in the gut and hypodermis of the embryo this tissue-specific expression raises the possibility that the dif-1 protein acts non-cell autonomously and that some communication or molecular transport dependent on dif-1 takes place during embryonic tissue differentiation dif-1 is the first mitochondrial carrier homologue known to be needed specifically for a developmental process
E,arabidopsis thaliana arabidopsis is unique among plant model organisms in having a small genome 130-140 mb excellent physical and genetic maps and little repetitive dna here we report the sequence of chromosome 2 from the columbia ecotype in two gap-free assemblies contigs of 36 and 16 megabases mb the latter represents the longest published stretch of uninterrupted dna sequence assembled from any organism to date chromosome 2 represents 15 of the genome and encodes 4037 genes 49 of which have no predicted function roughly 250 tandem gene duplications were found in addition to large-scale duplications of about 05 and 45 mb between chromosomes 2 and 1 and between chromosomes 2 and 4 respectively sequencing of nearly 2 mb within the genetically defined centromere revealed a low density of recognizable genes and a high density and diverse range of vestigial and presumably inactive mobile elements more unexpected is what appears to be a recent insertion of a continuous stretch of 75 of the mitochondrial genome into chromosome 2
E,calponin is a smooth muscle specific actin- tropomyosin- and calmodulin-binding protein thought to be involved in some way in the regulation or modulation of contraction here we describe the cloning and bacterial expression of two calponin species from murine and porcine smooth muscle tissues primary and secondary structural analyses of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed a high degree of homology to avian calponin with the exception of a short and variable c-terminal segment the sequence data demonstrate that the two mammalian calponin variants do not arise via alternative splicing but are encoded by different genes
B,prochlorococcus marinus the dominant photosynthetic organism in the ocean is found in two main ecological forms high-light-adapted genotypes in the upper part of the water column and low-light-adapted genotypes at the bottom of the illuminated layer p marinus ss120 the complete genome sequence reported here is an extremely low-light-adapted form the genome of p marinus ss120 is composed of a single circular chromosome of 1751080 bp with an average gc content of 364 it contains 1884 predicted protein-coding genes with an average size of 825 bp a single rrna operon and 40 trna genes together with the 166-mbp genome of p marinus med4 the genome of p marinus ss120 is one of the two smallest genomes of a photosynthetic organism known to date it lacks many genes that are involved in photosynthesis dna repair solute uptake intermediary metabolism motility phototaxis and other functions that are conserved among other cyanobacteria systems of signal transduction and environmental stress response show a particularly drastic reduction in the number of components even taking into account the small size of the ss120 genome in contrast housekeeping genes which encode enzymes of amino acid nucleotide cofactor and cell wall biosynthesis are all present because of its remarkable compactness the genome of p marinus ss120 might approximate the minimal gene complement of a photosynthetic organism
E,the sperm acrosome is a regulated secretory granule that undergoes exocytosis during fertilization to elucidate the structural organization of the contents within the acrosome guinea pig sperm acrosomal apical segments were isolated and mapped by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis page although complex the two-dimensional page map was dominated by two mr 50000 polypeptides p50 and proacrosin a mr 67000 polypeptide p67 and a mr 32000 polypeptide sp32 proacrosin pi  80 p67 and sp32 were extracted from apical segments by 1 m nacl protein p50 a relatively acidic polypeptide was not extracted in 1 m nacl andor 1 triton x-100 at 4 degrees c but was solubilized with 6 m urea protein p50 was purified from the urea extract by elution from deae-sephacel with 100 mm guanidine hcl and appeared homogeneous by sds-page antibodies to p50 were monospecific as judged by western blot analysis indirect immunofluorescence indicated that p50 was restricted to the acrosomal apical segment incubation of apical segments at ph 75 in the presence of 1 mm edta at 37 degrees c resulted in the release of p50 into the 200000 x g supernatant fluid a process that was reversed by a subsequent incubation with 15 mm cacl2 but not with mgcl2 the ca2-dependent reassociation of p50 with the acrosomal apical segments was reversed by the addition of 20 mm egta indicating that p50 binding is dependent on free ca2 concentrations when acrosomal matrices were purified following triton x-100 extraction p50 was the major component with p67 proacrosin and sp32 as less prominent constituents molecular cloning demonstrated that p50 is a unique testis-specific member of the pentaxin family of calcium-dependent binding proteins
B,n-terminal formylation of ribosome-synthesized polypeptides is assumed to be among the most conserved features that distinguish the eubacterial line of descent from other living phyla in order to assess the ancientness of this trait def genes encoding polypeptide deformylase were characterized from four eubacterial species lactococcus lactis bacillus subtilis calothrix pcc7601 and thermotoga maritima taking advantage of the conditional viability of the def mutants of escherichia coli altogether eight sequences of polypeptide deformylase have been obtained from all the eubacterial sources which were investigated either through systematic genome sequence analysis or through genetic screening yielding a highly homologous family a gene putatively encoding met-trnai formyltransferase fmt was found downstream of the deformylase gene except in l lactis mycoplasma genitalium calothrix pcc7601 and t maritima these results argue strongly for the ancestral character of n-terminal formylation in eubacteria most of the wide deviations of amino acid usage observed in def- and fmt-encoded proteins among species is best accounted for by the nucleotide composition of genomes furthermore the species of origin of each protein appears to be more recognizable than its function considering only its amino acid composition
E,butyrate and its structural analogues have recently entered clinical trials as a potential drug for differentiation therapy of advanced prostate cancer to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in prostate cancer differentiation we used mrna differential display to identify the genes induced by butyrate we found that the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line pc-3 undergoes terminal differentiation and apoptosis after treatment with sodium butyrate nabu a novel cdna designated carboxypeptidase a3 cpa3 which was up-regulated in nabu-treated pc-3 cells was identified and characterized this gene expresses a 2795-bp mrna encoding a protein with an open reading frame of 421 amino acids cpa3 has 37-63 amino acid identity with zinc cps from different mammalian species it also shares 27-43 amino acid similarity with zinc cps from several nonmammalian species including escherichia coli yeast caenorhabditis elegans and drosophila the structural similarity between cpa3 and its closest homologues indicates that the putative cpa3 protein contains a 16-residue signal peptide sequence a 95-residue nh2-terminal activation segment and a 310-residue cp enzyme domain the consistent induction of cpa3 by nabu in several prostate cancer cell lines led us to investigate the signaling pathway involved in the induction of cpa3 mrna trichostatin a a potent and specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase also induced cpa3 mrna expression suggesting that cpa3 gene induction is mediated by histone hyperacetylation we demonstrated that cpa3 induction was a downstream effect of the treatment with butyrate or trichostatin a but that the induction of p21waf1cip1 occurred immediately after these treatments we also demonstrated that the induction of cpa3 mrna by nabu was inhibited by p21waf1cip1 antisense mrna expression indicating that p21 transactivation is required for the induction of cpa3 by nabu our data demonstrate that the histone hyperacetylation signaling pathway is activated during nabu-mediated differentiation of pc-3 cells and the new gene cpa3 is involved in this pathway
B,the bacterium escherichia coli o157h7 is a worldwide threat to public health and has been implicated in many outbreaks of haemorrhagic colitis some of which included fatalities caused by haemolytic uraemic syndrome close to 75000 cases of o157h7 infection are now estimated to occur annually in the united states the severity of disease the lack of effective treatment and the potential for large-scale outbreaks from contaminated food supplies have propelled intensive research on the pathogenesis and detection of e coli o157h7 ref 4 here we have sequenced the genome of e coli o157h7 to identify candidate genes responsible for pathogenesis to develop better methods of strain detection and to advance our understanding of the evolution of e coli through comparison with the genome of the non-pathogenic laboratory strain e coli k-12 ref 5 we find that lateral gene transfer is far more extensive than previously anticipated in fact 1387 new genes encoded in strain-specific clusters of diverse sizes were found in o157h7 these include candidate virulence factors alternative metabolic capacities several prophages and other new functions--all of which could be targets for surveillance
B,the gene coding for an antigenic 34-kda protein of mycobacterium paratuberculosis was isolated and sequenced the 897-bp open reading frame coded for a novel protein containing specific b epitopes the occurrence of well-defined hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions suggests the wall location of the protein
B,the genus xanthomonas is a diverse and economically important group of bacterial phytopathogens belonging to the gamma-subdivision of the proteobacteria xanthomonas axonopodis pv citri xac causes citrus canker which affects most commercial citrus cultivars resulting in significant losses worldwide symptoms include canker lesions leading to abscission of fruit and leaves and general tree decline xanthomonas campestris pv campestris xcc causes black rot which affects crucifers such as brassica and arabidopsis symptoms include marginal leaf chlorosis and darkening of vascular tissue accompanied by extensive wilting and necrosis xanthomonas campestris pv campestris is grown commercially to produce the exopolysaccharide xanthan gum which is used as a viscosifying and stabilizing agent in many industries here we report and compare the complete genome sequences of xac and xcc their distinct disease phenotypes and host ranges belie a high degree of similarity at the genomic level more than 80 of genes are shared and gene order is conserved along most of their respective chromosomes we identified several groups of strain-specific genes and on the basis of these groups we propose mechanisms that may explain the differing host specificities and pathogenic processes
E,lipoproteina is an ldl-like lipoprotein whose concentration in plasma is correlated with atherosclerosis the characteristic protein component of lipoproteina is apolipoproteina which is disulphide-linked to apolipoprotein b-100 sequencing of cloned human apolipoproteina complementary dna shows that it is very similar to human plasminogen it contains a serine protease domain and two types of plasminogen-like kringle domains one of which is present in 37 copies
E,expression of major histocompatibility complex mhc class ii molecules and ability to present antigen to t lymphocytes is acquired upon activation of the macrophage by interferon-gamma ifn-gamma little information is available concerning immune regulation of protease gene expression in mouse macrophages we have isolated a cdna clone for cathepsin h a lysosomal cysteine proteinase from a cdna subtraction library of mouse macrophage genes induced by ifn-gamma and have characterized its expression the level of cathepsin h mrna increased in mouse peritoneal macrophages following addition of ifn-gamma cathepsin h mrna levels began to increase 8 h after the addition of ifn-gamma and was maximal at 24-48 h this increase was concordant in time with appearance of mhc class ii e beta mrna and ia invariant chain mrna the increase in cathepsin h mrna levels by ifn-gamma was dose dependent cycloheximide treatment of peritoneal macrophages inhibited the increase in cathepsin h mrna levels induced by ifn-gamma suggesting that the increase in cathepsin mrna levels requires de novo protein synthesis lipopolysaccharide and cytokines interleukin-2 il-2 il-4 il-10 and tumor necrosis factor alpha were found to have no effect on cathepsin h mrna levels in mouse peritoneal macrophages
E,cyp2j subfamily cytochromes p450 catalyze the nadph-dependent oxidation of arachidonic acid to several unique eicosanoids that possess numerous biological activities including modulation of ion transport control of bronchial and vascular smooth muscle tone and stimulation of peptide hormone secretion we have identified sequence variants in the 3' untranslated regions of two mouse cyp2j genes cyp2j5 and cyp2j6 and used a pcr-based oligonucleotide hybridization assay to map both genes to the central region of chromosome 4 distal to the jun oncogene the corresponding human cyp2j gene cyp2j2 has been assigned to human chromosome 1 on a panel of somatic hybrid cell lines and to 1p313-p312 by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis the proximity of the cyp2j cluster to the cyp4a cluster suggests that these genes may be part of a cassette of p450 genes involved in the oxidation of fatty acids
E,the higher plant arabidopsis thaliana arabidopsis is an important model for identifying plant genes and determining their function to assist biological investigations and to define chromosome structure a coordinated effort to sequence the arabidopsis genome was initiated in late 1996 here we report one of the first milestones of this project the sequence of chromosome 4 analysis of 1738 megabases of unique sequence representing about 17 of the genome reveals 3744 protein coding genes 81 transfer rnas and numerous repeat elements heterochromatic regions surrounding the putative centromere which has not yet been completely sequenced are characterized by an increased frequency of a variety of repeats new repeats reduced recombination lowered gene density and lowered gene expression roughly 60 of the predicted protein-coding genes have been functionally characterized on the basis of their homology to known genes many genes encode predicted proteins that are homologous to human and caenorhabditis elegans proteins
E,the adenylyl cyclase type vi gene expressed in human normal thyroid tissue was cloned and sequenced the cdna sequence 6463 nt is susceptible to code for a 1168 aa protein northern blots using specific probes showed that the expression of adenylyl cyclase type vi gene was significantly higher in one hyperfunctioning thyroid tumor than in normal thyroid tissue in one follicular cold adenoma or in one papillary carcinoma
E,computer-assisted database analysis of sequences homologous to human acid ceramidase asah revealed a 1233-bp cdna previously designated cpj-ltr whose 266-amino-acid open reading frame had approximately 36 identity with the asah polypeptide based on this high degree of homology we undertook further molecular characterization of cpj-ltr and now report the full-length cdna sequence complete gene structure renamed human asahl since it is a human acid ceramidase-like sequence chromosomal location primer extension and promoter analysis and transient expression results the full-length human asahl cdna was 1825 bp and contained an open-reading frame encoding a 359-amino-acid polypeptide that was 33 identical and 69 similar to the asah polypeptide over its entire length numerous short regions of complete identity were observed between these two sequences and two sequences obtained from the caenorhabditis elegans genome database the 30-kb human asahl genomic sequence contained 11 exons which ranged in size from 26 to 671 bp and 10 introns which ranged from 150 bp to 64 kb the gene was localized to the chromosomal region 4q211 by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis northern blotting experiments revealed a major 20-kb asahl transcript that was expressed at high levels in the liver and kidney but at relatively low levels in other tissues such as the lung heart and brain sequence analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the human asahl gene revealed a putative promoter region that lacked a tata box and was gc rich typical features of a housekeeping gene promoter as well as several tissue-specific andor hormone-induced transcription regulatory sites 5'-deletion analysis localized the promoter activity to a 1 1-kb fragment within this region a major transcription start site also was located 72 bp upstream from the atg translation initiation site by primer extension analysis expression analysis of a green fluorescence proteinasahl fusion protein in cos-1 cells revealed a punctate perinuclear distribution although no acid ceramidase activity was detected in the transfected cells using a fluorescence-based in vitro assay system
B,within the framework of an international project for the sequencing of the entire bacillus subtilis genome this paper communicates the sequencing of a chromosome region containing the lic and cel loci 65 kb which creates a 177 kb contig covering the region from gnt to sacxy this 65 kb region contains 64 orfs 62 complete and two partial genes the 14th 15th and 17th genes correspond to lict lics and kate encoding the antiterminator for lics transcription beta-glucanase lichenase and catalase 2 respectively the 11th 30th 36th 39th 41st 45th-48th 51st and 58th genes are designated dead pept gale aldy msmx cydabcd sigy and katx because their products probably encode atp-dependent rna helicase tripeptidase udp-glucose 4-epimerase aldehyde dehydrogenase multiple sugar-binding transport atp-binding protein the respective components of cytochrome d ubiquinol oxidase and atp-binding cassette transporter sigma-factor of rna polymerase and catalase respectively the 60th-64th genes are celrabcd which are probably involved in cellobiose utilization gene organization and gene features in the gnt-sacxy region are discussed
B,the nucleotide sequences of cloned genes coding for the elongation factor tu of seven eubacteria have been determined these genes were from anacystis nidulans bacillus subtilis bacteroides fragilis deinonema spec pseudomonas cepacia shewanella putrefaciens and streptococcus oralis the primary structures of the genes were compared to the available sequences of prokaryotic elongation factors tu and eukaryotic elongation factors 1 alpha a conservation profile was determined for homologous amino acid residues sites of known or putative functions are usually located at highly conserved positions or within highly conserved sequence stretches the aligned 24 amino acid sequences were used as basis for a phylogenetic analysis the phylogenetic tree corroborates the kingdom as well as phylum concept deduced from 16s rrna data
E,the hiv-1 tat protein regulates transcription elongation through binding to the viral tar rna stem-loop structure we have isolated a novel 87 kda cyclin c-related protein cyclin t that interacts specifically with the transactivation domain of tat cyclin t is a partner for cdk9 an rnapii transcription elongation factor remarkably the interaction of tat with cyclin t strongly enhances the affinity and specificity of the tattar rna interaction and confers a requirement for sequences in the loop of tar that are not recognized by tat alone moreover overexpression of human cyclin t rescues tat activity in nonpermissive rodent cells we propose that tat directs cyclin t-cdk9 to rnapii through cooperative binding to tar rna
E,the bmal1 gene encodes a member of the basic helix-loop-helixper-arnt-sim bhlhpas family of transcription factors it is a key regulator of circadian rhythms using sequence information from human bmal1 hbmal1 cdnas previously reported by our laboratory we have isolated and characterized cdnas encoding three splice variants of the mouse bmal1 mbmal1 gene of the three splice variants mbmal1b extends for 1878 bp in the coding sequence which is 91 identical to that of hbmal1b its deduced amino acid sequence is 626 residues long and is 98 identical to that of hbmal1b and sequence identities in the bhlh pas-a and pas-b regions are 98 100 and 100 respectively mbmal1b' arises from alternative usage of exon 2 which results in a 7-amino-acid insertion and alternative splice acceptor usage at the intron 9exon 10 splice junction which causes an alanine residue deletion mbmal1b' encodes 632 amino acids and contains the bhlhpas domains mbmal1g' is generated by alternative splice acceptor usage at the intron 6exon 7 splice junction which results in a 28-bp deletion adjacent to the 5' end of the pas domain since the 28-bp deletion shifts the reading frame mbmal1g' is predicted to encode a product of only 222 amino acids that lacks the pas domain the tissue distributions of the three splice variants showed some variation the variations in the tissue distributions and predicted amino acid sequences suggest that the three splice variants may have different functions direct sequencing of the genomic mbmal1 clones indicated that the coding sequence of mbmal1 spans 32 kb and includes 17 exons an unusual exonintron donor sequence was found in intron 14 which begins with gc at the 5' end comparison with the bhlhpas family genes revealed that the intronexon splice pattern of mbmal1 most closely matches that of the mahr which suggests that bmal1 and ahr belong to the same subclass and may be derived from a common primordial gene
B,countless millions of people have died from tuberculosis a chronic infectious disease caused by the tubercle bacillus the complete genome sequence of the best-characterized strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv has been determined and analysed in order to improve our understanding of the biology of this slow-growing pathogen and to help the conception of new prophylactic and therapeutic interventions the genome comprises 4411529 base pairs contains around 4000 genes and has a very high guanine  cytosine content that is reflected in the blased amino-acid content of the proteins m tuberculosis differs radically from other bacteria in that a very large portion of its coding capacity is devoted to the production of enzymes involved in lipogenesis and lipolysis and to two new families of glycine-rich proteins with a repetitive structure that may represent a source of antigenic variation
E,we have characterized a new family of silkmoth chorion genes called c which is distinct from previously characterized a and b families the amino acid compositions of 18 purified c proteins have been determined three subgroups are recognized on the basis of compositional similarities and may correspond to distinct gene families or subfamilies the sequences of two overlapping cdna clones have been determined in their entirety and shown to correspond to a c-specific sequence obvious homology is observed between the middle portions of the c sequence and previously characterized b sequences by contrast the arms of the c sequence share no significant similarities either with each other or with the corresponding arms of b sequences thus the same tripartite structure originally observed in a and b family sequences is also present in the c family and may have functional significance secondary structure prediction of the c sequence is presented and supports this conclusion the observed homology between c and b family sequences clearly establishes that silkmoth chorion multigene families constitute a superfamily
B,salmonella enterica subspecies i serovar typhimurium s typhimurium is a leading cause of human gastroenteritis and is used as a mouse model of human typhoid fever the incidence of non-typhoid salmonellosis is increasing worldwide causing millions of infections and many deaths in the human population each year here we sequenced the 4857-kilobase kb chromosome and 94-kb virulence plasmid of s typhimurium strain lt2 the distribution of close homologues of s typhimurium lt2 genes in eight related enterobacteria was determined using previously completed genomes of three related bacteria sample sequencing of both s enterica serovar paratyphi a s paratyphi a and klebsiella pneumoniae and hybridization of three unsequenced genomes to a microarray of s typhimurium lt2 genes lateral transfer of genes is frequent with 11 of the s typhimurium lt2 genes missing from s enterica serovar typhi s typhi and 29 missing from escherichia coli k12 the 352 gene homologues of s typhimurium lt2 confined to subspecies i of s enterica-containing most mammalian and bird pathogens-are useful for studies of epidemiology host specificity and pathogenesis most of these homologues were previously unknown and 50 may be exported to the periplasm or outer membrane rendering them accessible as therapeutic or vaccine targets
B,bifidobacteria are gram-positive prokaryotes that naturally colonize the human gastrointestinal tract git and vagina although not numerically dominant in the complex intestinal microflora they are considered as key commensals that promote a healthy git we determined the 226-mb genome sequence of an infant-derived strain of bifidobacterium longum and identified 1730 possible coding sequences organized in a 60-gc circular chromosome bioinformatic analysis revealed several physiological traits that could partially explain the successful adaptation of this bacteria to the colon an unexpectedly large number of the predicted proteins appeared to be specialized for catabolism of a variety of oligosaccharides some possibly released by rare or novel glycosyl hydrolases acting on nondigestible plant polymers or host-derived glycoproteins and glycoconjugates this ability to scavenge from a large variety of nutrients likely contributes to the competitiveness and persistence of bifidobacteria in the colon many genes for oligosaccharide metabolism were found in self-regulated modules that appear to have arisen in part from gene duplication or horizontal acquisition complete pathways for all amino acids nucleotides and some key vitamins were identified however routes for asp and cys were atypical more importantly genome analysis provided insights into the reciprocal interactions of bifidobacteria with their hosts we identified polypeptides that showed homology to most major proteins needed for production of glycoprotein-binding fimbriae structures that could possibly be important for adhesion and persistence in the git we also found a eukaryotic-type serine protease inhibitor serpin possibly involved in the reported immunomodulatory activity of bifidobacteria
E,chlorella protothecoides cultures grown in a nitrogen-free bleaching medium bm-n in the dark rapidly degraded chlorophyll chl to red catabolites this degreening process was investigated under different growth conditions supply of nitrogen to the culture medium bmn inhibited bleaching and the synthesis of catabolites as did the addition to bm-n of cycloheximide or a chelator 22'-bipyridyl in contrast chloramphenicol or the protease inhibitor e64 had no effect during bleaching chl breakdown was accompanied by the degradation of cellular proteins such as light-harvesting complex ii cytochrome f and protochlorophyllide oxido-reductase during growth in bm-n protease activity increased and proteins immunologically detectable with an antibody against a senescence-enhanced cysteine protease accumulated cdnas from bm-n and bmn cells were used for differential and subtractive screening to isolate cdnas representing genes with degreening-enhanced expression dee in c protothecoides several different dees were identified with different patterns of expression during chlorella growth but which were all expressed at higher levels during bleaching among these dee4 was most abundant and its expression was exclusive in bm-n cultures analysis of the dee sequences showed that they encode different proteins including a novel amino acid carrier dee4 ferritin atp-dependent citrate lyase a ca2-binding protein mo25 ubiquinone-cytochrome c-reductase and several new proteins
E,human and mouse cdnas showing homology to the clostridium perfringens enterotoxin cpe receptor gene cpe-r from vero cells ddbjemblgenbanktm accession no d88492 katahira j inoue n horiguchi y matsuda m and sugimoto n 1997 j cell biol 136 1239-1247 were cloned they were classified into two groups the vero cell cpe receptor homologues and rat androgen withdrawal apoptosis protein rvp1 accession no m74067 homologues based on the similarities of primary amino acid sequences l929 cells that were originally insensitive to cpe became sensitive to cpe on their transfection with cdnas encoding either the cpe receptor or rvp1 homologues indicating that these gene products are not only structurally similar but also functionally active as receptors for cpe by binding assay the human rvp1 homologue showed differences in affinity and capacity of binding from those of the human cpe receptor northern blot analysis showed that mouse homologues of the cpe receptor and rvp1 are expressed abundantly in mouse small intestine the expression of cpe-r mrna in the small intestine was restricted to cryptic enterocytes indicating that the cpe receptor is expressed in intestinal epithelial cells these results are consistent with reports that cpe binds to the small intestinal cells via two different kinds of receptors high levels of expression of cpe-r andor rvp1 mrna were also detected in other organs including the lungs liver and kidneys but only low levels were expressed in heart and skeletal muscles these results indicate that cpe uses structurally related cellular proteins as functional receptors in vivo and that organs that have not so far been recognized as cpe-sensitive have the potential to be targets of cpe
B,analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the distal part of the fan gene cluster encoding the proteins involved in the biosynthesis of the fibrillar adhesin k99 revealed the presence of two structural genes fang and fanh the amino acid sequence of the gene products fang and fanh showed significant homology to the amino acid sequence of the fibrillar subunit protein fanc introduction of a site-specific frameshift mutation in fang or fanh resulted in a simultaneous decrease in fibrillae production and adhesive capacity analysis of subcellular fractions showed that in contrast to the k99 fibrillar subunit fanc both the fanh and the fang protein were loosely associated with the outer membrane possibly on the periplasmic side but were not components of the fimbriae themselves
E,an expression cloning method which allows direct isolation of cdnas encoding substrates for tyrosine kinases was applied to the study of the epidermal growth factor egf receptor egfr signaling pathway a previously undescribed cdna was isolated and designated eps15 the structural features of the predicted eps15 gene product allow its subdivision into three domains domain i contains signatures of a regulatory domain including a candidate tyrosine phosphorylation site and ef-hand-type calcium-binding domains domain ii presents the characteristic heptad repeats of coiled-coil rod-like proteins and domain iii displays a repeated aspartic acid-proline-phenylalanine motif similar to a consensus sequence of several methylases antibodies specific for the eps15 gene product recognize two proteins a major species of 142 kda and a minor component of 155 kda both of which are phosphorylated on tyrosine following egfr activation by egf in vivo egfr is also able to directly phosphorylate the eps15 product in vitro in addition phosphorylation of the eps15 gene product in vivo is relatively receptor specific since the erbb-2 kinase phosphorylates it very inefficiently finally overexpression of eps15 is sufficient to transform nih 3t3 cells thus suggesting that the eps15 gene product is involved in the regulation of mitogenic signals
B,two forms of heat-stable zinc-containing beta-lactamase ii have been described for strains of bacillus cereus and have been shown to differ in substrate specificity r b davies e p abraham j fleming and m r pollock biochem j 145 409-411 1975 we report here the nucleotide sequence inferred amino acid sequence and expression of beta-lactamase ii from b cereus 5b6 and compare our results with those for its homolog characterized in b cereus 569h m hussain c anthony m j madonna and j o lampen j bacteriol 164 223-229 1985 to document amino acid differences contributing to the specific properties of these enzymes
E,cd44 is a cell-surface glycoprotein involved in leukocyte adherence t-cell activation and lymphocyte homing we have isolated and sequenced a cdna clone which encodes for bovine cd44 the predicted amino acid sequence of bovine cd44 has an overall high similarity with that of human and mouse cd44 795 and 732 respectively in all three species cd44 has a similar transmembrane region and cytoplasmic tail in addition all of the cysteine residues and a majority of the putative n-linked glycosylation sites in the extracytoplasmic domain are conserved between bovine human and mouse all three species have an area of low interspecies similarity within the extracytoplasmic domain this area has a similarity of 34 between bovine and human 27 between bovine and mouse and 35 between human and mouse the location of this area of low similarity is conserved between species
B,the genome sequences of chlamydia trachomatis mouse pneumonitis mopn strain nigg 1 069 412 nt and chlamydia pneumoniae strain ar39 1 229 853 nt were determined using a random shotgun strategy the mopn genome exhibited a general conservation of gene order and content with the previously sequenced ctrachomatis serovar d differences between ctrachomatis strains were focused on an approximately 50 kb 'plasticity zone' near the termination origins in this region mopn contained three copies of a novel gene encoding a 3000 amino acid toxin homologous to a predicted toxin from escherichia coli o157h7 but had apparently lost the tryptophan biosyntheis genes found in serovar d in this region the c pneumoniae ar39 chromosome was 999 identical to the previously sequenced cpneumoniae cwl029 genome however comparative analysis identified an invertible dna segment upstream of the uridine kinase gene which was in different orientations in the two genomes ar39 also contained a novel 4524 nt circular single-stranded ssdna bacteriophage the first time a virus has been reported infecting c pneumoniae although the chlamydial genomes were highly conserved there were intriguing differences in key nucleotide salvage pathways cpneumoniae has a uridine kinase gene for dutp production mopn has a uracil phosphororibosyl transferase while ctrachomatis serovar d contains neither gene chromosomal comparison revealed that there had been multiple large inversion events since the species divergence of ctrachomatis and cpneumoniae apparently oriented around the axis of the origin of replication and the termination region the striking synteny of the chlamydia genomes and prevalence of tandemly duplicated genes are evidence of minimal chromosome rearrangement and foreign gene uptake presumably owing to the ecological isolation of the obligate intracellular parasites in the absence of genetic analysis comparative genomics will continue to provide insight into the virulence mechanisms of these important human pathogens
B,the 567-megabase genome of the plant pathogen agrobacterium tumefaciens c58 consists of a circular chromosome a linear chromosome and two plasmids extensive orthology and nucleotide colinearity between the genomes of a tumefaciens and the plant symbiont sinorhizobium meliloti suggest a recent evolutionary divergence their similarities include metabolic transport and regulatory systems that promote survival in the highly competitive rhizosphere differences are apparent in their genome structure and virulence gene complement availability of the a tumefaciens sequence will facilitate investigations into the molecular basis of pathogenesis and the evolutionary divergence of pathogenic and symbiotic lifestyles
E,we have identified a serinethreonine kinase that is rapidly activated during fas-mediated apoptosis fas-activated serinethreonine kinase fast is phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues in jurkat cells in response to fas ligation it is rapidly dephosphorylated and concomitantly activated to phosphorylate tia-1 a nuclear rna-binding protein that has been implicated as an effector of apoptosis phosphorylation of tia-1 precedes the onset of dna fragmentation suggesting a role in signaling downstream events in the apoptotic program our results introduce fast and tia-1 as components of a molecular cascade involved in signaling fas-mediated apoptosis
E,a molecular phylogeny of the subfamily antilopinae was determined using the two mitochondrial dna mtdna genes cytochrome b and cytochrome c oxidase iii the tribe antilopini is monophyletic with antidorcas marsupialis and litocranius walleri basal to the large genus gazella antilope cervicapra falls within gazella this placement would either make gazella paraphyletic or require that the genus name gazella be changed to antilope gazella thomsonii is supported as a subspecies of g rufifrons most members of the tribe neotragini are sister species to the antilopini but the neotragini is rendered paraphyletic by a deep placement of neotragus moschatus
A,methanogenesis the biological production of methane plays a pivotal role in the global carbon cycle and contributes significantly to global warming the majority of methane in nature is derived from acetate here we report the complete genome sequence of an acetate-utilizing methanogen methanosarcina acetivorans c2a methanosarcineae are the most metabolically diverse methanogens thrive in a broad range of environments and are unique among the archaea in forming complex multicellular structures this diversity is reflected in the genome of m acetivorans at 5751492 base pairs it is by far the largest known archaeal genome the 4524 open reading frames code for a strikingly wide and unanticipated variety of metabolic and cellular capabilities the presence of novel methyltransferases indicates the likelihood of undiscovered natural energy sources for methanogenesis whereas the presence of single-subunit carbon monoxide dehydrogenases raises the possibility of nonmethanogenic growth although motility has not been observed in any methanosarcineae a flagellin gene cluster and two complete chemotaxis gene clusters were identified the availability of genetic methods coupled with its physiological and metabolic diversity makes m acetivorans a powerful model organism for the study of archaeal biology sequence data annotations and analyses are available at httpwww-genomewimitedu
E,calpains are a superfamily of related proteins some of which have been shown to function as calcium-dependent cysteine proteases in mammals eight different calpains have been identified we report the identification of a new mammalian calpain gene capn11 the predicted protein possesses the features typical of calpains including potential protease and calcium-binding domains the capn11 mrna exhibits a highly restricted tissue distribution with highest levels present in testis radiation hybrid mapping localized the gene to human chromosome 6 within a region mapped to p12 phylogenetic analysis suggests that in mammals the predicted capn11 protein is most closely related to capn1 and capn2 however of the calpain sequences available the predicted capn11 sequence exhibits greatest homology to the chicken microm calpain thus capn11 may be the human orthologue of microm calpain the discovery of this new calpain emphasizes the complexity of the calpain family with members being distinguished on the basis of protease activity calcium dependence and tissue expression
B,the bacillus subtilis genome encodes two multidrug efflux transporters sharing 51 sequence identity bmr described previously and blt described here overexpression of either transporter in b subtilis leads to a similar increase in resistance to ethidium bromide rhodamine and acridine dyes tetraphenylphosphonium doxorubicin and fluoroquinolone antibiotics however blt differs widely from bmr in its expression pattern under standard cultivation conditions b subtilis expresses bmr but blt expression is undetectable we have previously shown that bmr expression is regulated by bmrr a member of the family of merr-like transcriptional activators here we show that blt transcription is regulated by another member of the same family bltr the dna-binding domains of bmrr and bltr are related but their putative inducer-binding domains are dissimilar suggesting that bmr and blt are expressed in response to different inducers indeed rhodamine a substrate of bmr and blt and a known inducer of bmr expression does not induce blt expression blt expression has been observed only in b subtilis carrying mutation acfa which as we show here alters the sequence of the blt gene promoter unlike bmr which is transcribed as a monocistronic mrna blt is cotranscribed with a downstream gene encoding a putative acetyltransferase overall the differences in transcriptional control and operon organization between bmr and blt suggest that the transporters encoded by these genes have independent functions involving the transport of distinct physiological compounds
B,we report that vibrio cholerae vc contains a gene homologous to escherichia coli dnae the structural gene for the alpha catalytic subunit of replicative dna polymerase iii poliii despite 24 amino acid aa differences in the encoded proteins the vc gene strongly complements an e coli dnae temperature sensitive ts mutant indicating that all functional features essential for replication are conserved
E,using low-stringency hybridization and polymerase chain reaction pcr-based dna amplification we have isolated three drosophila melanogaster genes that encode troponin-c isoforms and one specifying a protein that is closely related to calmodulin two of the troponin-c genes located within the 47d and 73f subdivisions of chromosomes 2 and 3 respectively encode very closely related isoforms that specified by the 47d gene accumulates almost exclusively in larval muscles while that encoded by the 73f gene is present in both larvae and adults the third gene located within the 41c subdivision of chromosome 2 encodes a more distantly related troponin-c isoform that accumulates only within adults the gene that encodes the calmodulin-related protein is located within the 97a subdivision of chromosome three the protein encoded by this gene has a different primary sequence from that of conventional calmodulin which is specified by a gene located within the 49a subdivision of chromosome 2 our report is the first to describe insect troponin-c isoforms and further avails genetic methods for investigating the in vivo functions of the troponin-cmyosin light-chaincalmodulin protein superfamily
E,the complete nucleotide sequence of the entire rabbit alpha s1-casein-encoding gene aslca and its flanking regions was determined these data represent the first complete primary sequence of an aslca gene the gene consists of 19 exons spread over 16 kb highly conserved sequences were found between this gene and other casein-encoding genes mainly upstream from the gene from position -180 to -10 several repeated interspersed elements of unknown function were also identified within introns
E,mutational analyses in model organisms have shown that genes affecting metabolism and stress resistance regulate life span but the genes responsible for variation in longevity in natural populations are largely unidentified previously we mapped quantitative trait loci qtls affecting variation in longevity between two drosophila melanogaster strains here we show that the longevity qtl in the 36e38b cytogenetic interval on chromosome 2 contains multiple closely linked qtls including the dopa decarboxylase ddc locus complementation tests to mutations show that ddc is a positional candidate gene for life span in these strains linkage disequilibrium ld mapping in a sample of 173 alleles from a single population shows that three common molecular polymorphisms in ddc account for 155 of the genetic contribution to variance in life span from chromosome 2 the polymorphisms are in strong ld and the effects of the haplotypes on longevity suggest that the polymorphisms are maintained by balancing selection ddc catalyzes the final step in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin thus these data implicate variation in the synthesis of bioamines as a factor contributing to natural variation in individual life span
E,a cap-binding protein complex cbc present in the nuclei of hela cells has been characterized purified cbc consists of two previously identified proteins cbp80 and cbp20 these proteins are shown to cofractionate to apparent homogeneity and to be coimmunoprecipitable with anti-cbp80 antibodies analysis of the inhibition of pre-mrna splicing in vitro and in vivo by chemically modified analogs of the cap structure and of the binding of these analogs to cbc in vitro suggests a role for the complex in splicing extracts immunodepleted of cbc do not efficiently splice an adenoviral pre-mrna owing to blockage of an early step in splicing complex formation cbc may therefore play a role in pre-mrna recognition
E,a cdna for chicken avidin was identified in a chicken oviduct cdna library by screening with antibodies and synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides four recombinant clones were characterized and each contained the sequence of the oligonucleotide probes used in screening they were capable also of expressing an antigen recognizable by a polyclonal or a mixture of monoclonal antibodies raised against avidin the longest clone lambda cav4 contained the entire coding sequence of avidin along with a signal peptide of 24 amino acids an avidin mrna approximately 700 nucleotides in length was induced by a single injection of progesterone over a period of twenty four hours the avidin mrna was distributed in a tissue-specific manner since detectable concentration of the mrna appeared only in the oviduct after stimulation with progesterone alone or with a combination of progesterone and estrogen no avidin mrna was detected in the liver or kidney under these conditions preliminary results on the genomic complexity of avidin suggest a single copy gene isolation of the natural gene for avidin and studies on its regulation now can be initiated using the cdna probe
B,during flagellar morphogenesis in salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli the flik gene product is responsible for hook length control a previous study m homma t iino and r m macnab j bacteriol 1702221-2228 1988 had suggested that the flik gene may generate two products we have confirmed that both proteins are products of the flik gene and have eliminated several possible explanations for the two forms we have determined the dna sequence of the flik gene in both bacterial species the deduced amino acid sequences of the wild-type flik proteins of s typhimurium and e coli correspond to molecular masses of 41748 and 39246 da respectively and are fairly hydrophilic alignment of the sequences gives an identity level of 50 which is low for homologous flagellar proteins from s typhimurium and e coli the c-terminal sequence is the most highly conserved part 71 identity in the last 154 amino acids the central and c-terminal regions are rich in proline and glutamine residues respectively linker insertion mutagenesis of the conserved c-terminal region completely abolished motility whereas disruption of the less conserved n-terminal and central regions had little or no effect we suggest that the n-terminal or n-terminal and central and c-terminal regions may constitute domains for several reasons we consider it unlikely that flik is functioning as a molecular ruler for determining hook length and conclude that it is probably employing a novel mechanism
E,a genomic dna clone encoding isocitrate lyase a key enzyme of the glyoxylate cycle and a peroxisomal enzyme of the n-alkane-assimilating yeast candida tropicalis has been isolated with a cdna probe from the yeast lambda embl library nucleotide sequence analysis of the genomic dna clone disclosed that the region coding isocitrate lyase had a length of 1650 base pairs corresponding to 550 amino acids 61602 da rna blot analysis demonstrated that only one kind of mrna 2 kb supposed to be transcribed from this gene was present in the cells a comparison of the amino acid sequences was made with the isocitrate lyase of castor bean one of the glyoxysomal enzymes and the enzyme of e coli the isocitrate lyases of c tropicalis and castor bean had high homology and the presence of some amino acid stretches conserved in all three enzymes suggests that these might be involved in the catalysis of the common reaction there was an insertion common to the isocitrate lyases of c tropicalis and castor bean which is of interest concerning their evolution in the c-terminal region a characteristic sequence similar to that previously proposed as the import signal to peroxisomes was present
B,the algj gene from azotobacter vinelandii was cloned using a labelled rna probe representing the coding region of the alge gene from pseudomonas aeruginosa dna sequencing revealed an orf of 1452 bp encoding a protein of 484 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 54611 da an rna probe corresponding to alge was also used for southern hybridization of chromosomal dna which showed that alge-related dna sequences are also present in the alginate-producing phytopathogen species pseudomonas marginalis and pseudomonas syringae pv glycinea the coding region of algj was subcloned in the expression vector pt7-7 leading to a corresponding gene product with an apparent molecular mass of 54 kda which could be identified in the outer membrane om of escherichia coli bl21de3 additionally a cross-reacting protein with the same molecular mass was also found in the om of a vinelandii using an anti-alge antiserum the derived amino acid sequence of algj shared approximately 52 identity with alge from p aeruginosa the hydrophilicity profile as well as the amphipathicity of regions in the amino acid sequence of algj showed significant similarities to alge based on these data a topological model of algj was created with the aid of known structures of outer-membrane proteins this model presents algj as a beta-barrel containing 18 beta-strands inserted in the om
E,for investigation of the relation of cell cycle regulation with tumorigenesis in cats we carried out molecular cloning of feline p21waf1 and p27kip1 cdnas and chromosomal mapping of these genes on the cat genome the feline p21waf1 cdna clone obtained in this study encoded 164 amino acids aa showing 835 and 768 sequence similarity with those of the human and mouse counterparts respectively the cat p27kip1 cdna clone isolated here encoded 198 aa showing sequence similarities of 934 and 904 with its human and mouse counterparts respectively using a panel of feline x rodent somatic cell hybrids the feline cdkn1a p21waf1 and cdkn1b p27kip1 loci were assigned to feline chromosomes b2 and b4 respectively southern-blot analyses of 17 feline spontaneous leukemia and lymphoma cases using these cdnas as probes did not reveal any rearrangements in either the p21waf1 or the p27kip1 gene rt-pcrsscp single strand conformation polymorphism analysis of p27kip1 cdna did not uncover any amino acid substitutions in the 10 feline leukemia and lymphoma cases that were examined
E,for the development of an efficient gene expression system in a shoyu koji mold aspergillus oryzae kbn616 the tef1 gene encoding translation-elongation factor 1 alpha was cloned from the same strain and used for expression of polygalacturonase genes the tef1 gene comprised 1647 bp with three introns the tef1-alpha protein consisted of 460 amino acids possessing high identify to other fungal tef proteins two nucleotide sequences homologous to the upstream activation sequence characterized for the ribosomal protein genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as the pyrimidine-rich sequences were present in the tef1 gene promoter region suggesting that the a oryzae tef1 gene has a strong promoter activity two expression vectors ptfga300 and ptfgb200 for production of polygalacturonases a and b respectively were constructed by using the tef1 gene promoter a polygalacturonase pgb gene cloned from the same strain comprised 1226 bp with two introns and encoded a protein of 367 amino acids with high similarity to other fungal polygalacturonases pga and pgb were secreted at approximately 100 mgl in glucose medium and purified to homogeneity pga had a molecular mass of 41 kda a ph optimum of 50 and temperature optimum of 45 degrees c pgb had a molecular mass of 39 kda a ph optimum of 50 and temperature optimum of 55 degrees c
E,we have sequenced a 11-mb region of human chromosome 22q containing the dosage-sensitive genes responsible for cat eye syndrome ces as well as the 450-kb homologous region on mouse chromosome 6 fourteen putative genes were identified within or adjacent to the human ces critical region cescr including three known genes il-17r atp6e and bid and nine novel genes based on est identity two putative genes cecr3 and cecr9 were identified in the absence of est hits by comparing segments of human and mouse genomic sequence around two solitary amplified exons thus showing the utility of comparative genomic sequence analysis in identifying transcripts of the 14 genes 10 were confirmed to be present in the mouse genomic sequence in the same order and orientation as in human absent from the mouse region of conserved synteny are cecr1 a promising ces candidate gene from the center of the contig neighboring cecr4 and cecr7 and cecr8 which are located in the gene-poor proximal 400 kb of the contig this latter proximal region located approximately 1 mb from the centromere shows abundant duplicated gene fragments typical of pericentromeric dna the margin of this region also delineates the boundary of conserved synteny between the cescr and mouse chromosome 6 because the proximal cescr appears abundant in duplicated segments and therefore is likely to be gene poor we consider the putative genes identified in the distal cescr to represent the majority of candidate genes for involvement in ces
E,a novel g protein-coupled receptor was isolated from a cdna derived from the cell line nh15-ca2 and a cdna library from adult mouse brain using a pcr cloning strategy the amino acid sequence of the candidate receptor dez showed homology to neuropeptide and chemoattractant receptors highest overall homology was found with the orphan receptor gpr-1 65 the angiotensin ii receptor 62 and the c5a anaphylatoxin receptor 60 northern blot analysis of dez revealed a predominant 26 kb mrna species in nh15-ca2 cells in situ hybridization experiments showed that dez is differentially regulated during development with a prominent expression in developing osseous and cartilaginous tissue it was also detectable in the adult parathyroid glands hinting at a possible function in bone metabolism
B,wild-type strains of campylobacter fetus are covered by a monomolecular array of surface layer proteins slps critical for virulence each cell possesses eight slp gene cassettes tightly clustered in the genome that encode slps of 97 to 149 kda variation of slp expression occurs by a mechanism of nested dna rearrangement that involves the inversion of a 62-kb sapa promoter-containing element alone or together with one or more flanking slp gene cassettes the presence of extensive regions of identity flanking the 5' and 3' ends of each slp gene cassette and of a chi-like recognition sequence within the 5' region of identity suggests that rearrangement of slp gene cassettes may occur by a generalized reca-dependent homologous recombination pathway to explore this possibility we cloned c fetus reca and created mutant strains by marker rescue in which reca is disrupted in either s or s- strains these mutants then were assessed for their abilities to alter slp expression either in the presence or absence of a complementary shuttle plasmid harboring native reca in contrast to all previously reported programmed dna inversion systems inversion in c fetus is reca dependent
E,we report the isolation and sequence of a cdna clone that encodes a locust schistocerca gregaria nervous system nicotinic acetylcholine receptor achr subunit alpha l1 the calculated molecular weight of the unglycosylated polypeptide which contains in the proposed extracellular domain two adjacent cysteine residues which are characteristic of alpha ligand binding subunits is 60641 daltons injection into xenopus oocytes of rna synthesized from this clone in vitro results in expression of functional nicotinic receptors in the oocyte membrane in these nicotine opens a cation channel the receptors are blocked by both alpha-bungarotoxin alpha-bgt and kappa-bungarotoxin kappa-bgt reversible block of the expressed insect achr by mecamylamine d-tubocurarine tetraethylammonium bicuculline and strychnine has also been observed these data are entirely consistent with previously reported electrophysiological studies on in vivo insect nicotinic receptors and also with biochemical studies on an alpha-bgt affinity purified locust achr thus a functional receptor exhibiting the characteristic pharmacology of an in vivo insect nicotinic achr can be expressed in xenopus oocytes by injection with a single subunit rna
B,a novel staphylolytic enzyme ale-1 acting on staphylococcus aureus was purified from a staphylococcus capitis epk1 culture supernatant the optimal ph range for staphylolytic activity was 7 to 9 ale-1 contains one zn2 atom per molecule analysis of peptidoglycan fragments released by ale-1 indicated that the enzyme is a glycylglycine endopeptidase the effects of various modulators were determined and we found that o-phenanthroline iodoacetic acid diethylpyrocarbonate and cu2 reduced the staphylolytic activity of ale-1 beta-casein elastin and pentaglycine were poor substrates for ale-1 molecular cloning data revealed that ale-1 is composed of 362 amino acid residues and is synthesized as a precursor protein which is cleaved after ala at position 35 thus producing a mature ale-1 of 356 kda the primary structure of mature ale-1 is very similar to the proenzyme form of lysostaphin it has the modular design of an n-terminal domain of tandem repeats of a 13-amino-acid sequence fused to the active site containing c-terminal domain unlike lysostaphin ale-1 does not undergo processing of the n-terminal repeat domain in broth culture ale-1 is encoded on the plasmid protein homology search suggested that ale-1 and lysostaphin are members of the novel zn2 protease family with a homologous 38-amino-acid-long motif tyr-x-his-x11-val-x1220-gly-x5-6-his
B,the adherence mechanisms of enteropathogenic escherichia coli epec to epithelial cells are still not understood to study the molecular basis of the diffuse adherence da phenotype exhibited by diarrhoeagenic e coli expressing classical epec serotypes we investigated strain 2787 o126h27 isolated from a case of infantile diarrhoea a 60 kb plasmid-derived dna fragment mediates the da phenotype and encodes the 100 kda adhesin protein aida-i adhesin involved in diffuse adherence sequencing of the entire fragment revealed two open reading frames which encoded proteins of 45 kda and 132 kda respectively the 132 kda protein has been identified as an aida-i precursor protein after cleavage of the signal sequence further processing at the c-terminus of the 132 kda precursor leads to the mature approximately 100 kda aida-i while the exact function of the cytoplasmic 45 kda protein is not known preliminary evidence indicates that it is necessary for the correct maturation of aida-i the aida-i precursor exhibits significant homology with the virgicsa protein of shigella flexneri which seems to be involved in the intercellular spread of invasive shigella organisms
E,alpha 2-adrenergic receptors comprise a heterogeneous population based on pharmacologic and molecular evidence we have isolated a cdna clone prng alpha 2 encoding a rat alpha 2-adrenergic receptor a rat kidney cdna library was screened with an oligonucleotide complementary to a highly conserved region found in all biogenic amine receptors described to date the deduced amino acid sequence displays many features of guanyl nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptors except it does not have a consensus n-linked glycosylation site near the amino terminus membranes prepared from cos cells transfected with prng alpha 2 dna display high affinity and saturable binding to 3hrauwolscine kd  2 nm competition curve data analysis shows that rng alpha 2 protein binds to a variety of adrenergic drugs with the following rank order of potency yohimbine greater than or equal to chlorpromazine greater than or equal to prazosin greater than or equal to clonidine greater than norepinephrine greater than or equal to oxymetazoline rng alpha 2 rna accumulates in both rat kidney and neonatal rat lung predominant species is 4000 nucleotides when a cysteine residue cys-169 that is conserved among all members of the seven-transmembrane-region superfamily is changed to phenylalanine the rng alpha 2 protein fails to bind 3hrauwolscine after expression in cos cells we conclude that prng alpha 2 likely represents a cdna for a rat alpha 2b-adrenergic receptor
B,xylella fastidiosa is a xylem-dwelling insect-transmitted gamma-proteobacterium that causes diseases in many plants including grapevine citrus periwinkle almond oleander and coffee x fastidiosa has an unusually broad host range has an extensive geographical distribution throughout the american continent and induces diverse disease phenotypes previous molecular analyses indicated three distinct groups of x fastidiosa isolates that were expected to be genetically divergent here we report the genome sequence of x fastidiosa temecula strain isolated from a naturally infected grapevine with pierce's disease pd in a wine-grape-growing region of california comparative analyses with a previously sequenced x fastidiosa strain responsible for citrus variegated chlorosis cvc revealed that 98 of the pd x fastidiosa temecula genes are shared with the cvc x fastidiosa strain 9a5c genes furthermore the average amino acid identity of the open reading frames in the strains is 957 genomic differences are limited to phage-associated chromosomal rearrangements and deletions that also account for the strain-specific genes present in each genome genomic islands one in each genome were identified and their presence in other x fastidiosa strains was analyzed we conclude that these two organisms have identical metabolic functions and are likely to use a common set of genes in plant colonization and pathogenesis permitting convergence of functional genomic strategies
E,we have cloned the murine ccr6 receptor and its ligand the beta-chemokine mmip-3alpha calcium mobilization assays performed with mccr6 transfectants showed significant responses upon addition of mmip-3alpha murine mip-3alpha rna is expressed in thymus small intestine and colon whereas mccr6 rna is expressed in spleen and lymph nodes rt-pcr analysis of facs-sorted lymphoid and antigen presenting cell subsets showed mccr6 expression mainly in b cells cd8- splenic dendritic cells and cd4 t cells the cloning and functional characterization of the mccr6 and mmip-3alpha will allow the study of the role of these proteins in mouse models of inflammation and immunity
B,the genus xanthomonas is a diverse and economically important group of bacterial phytopathogens belonging to the gamma-subdivision of the proteobacteria xanthomonas axonopodis pv citri xac causes citrus canker which affects most commercial citrus cultivars resulting in significant losses worldwide symptoms include canker lesions leading to abscission of fruit and leaves and general tree decline xanthomonas campestris pv campestris xcc causes black rot which affects crucifers such as brassica and arabidopsis symptoms include marginal leaf chlorosis and darkening of vascular tissue accompanied by extensive wilting and necrosis xanthomonas campestris pv campestris is grown commercially to produce the exopolysaccharide xanthan gum which is used as a viscosifying and stabilizing agent in many industries here we report and compare the complete genome sequences of xac and xcc their distinct disease phenotypes and host ranges belie a high degree of similarity at the genomic level more than 80 of genes are shared and gene order is conserved along most of their respective chromosomes we identified several groups of strain-specific genes and on the basis of these groups we propose mechanisms that may explain the differing host specificities and pathogenic processes
E,using the yeast two-hybrid system we have isolated a cdna designated bbp for bcl2-binding protein for a protein bbp that interacts with bcl2 bbp is identical to 53bp2 a partial clone of which was previously isolated in a two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with p53 in this study we show that specific interactions of bbp53bp2 with either bcl2 or p53 require its ankyrin repeats and sh3 domain these interactions can be reproduced in vitro with bacterially expressed fusion proteins and competition experiments indicate that bcl2 prevents p53 from binding to bbp53bp2 bbp53bp2 mrna is abundant in most cell lines examined but the protein cannot be stably expressed in a variety of cell types by transfection in transiently transfected cells bbp partially colocalizes with bcl2 in the cytoplasm and results in an increased number of cells at g2m possibly accounting for the inability to obtain stable transfectants expressing the protein these results demonstrate that a single protein can interact with either bcl2 or p53 both in yeast cells and in vitro the in vivo significance of these interactions and their potential consequences for cell cycle progression and cell death remain to be determined
E,a 328-bp sequence from exon 1 of the gene for aquaporin-2 aqp2 was compared in 12 mammalian species representing as many eutherian orders this sequence encodes the n-terminal half of this kidney-specific water channel protein most amino acid replacements as well as an insertion have occurred in extracellular loops connecting the transmembrane helices in agreement with a lower functional importance of these loops phylogenetic analyses were performed with parsimony distance and maximum-likelihood methods the aqp2 data set alone as well as in combination with previously published alpha a-crystallin protein sequences strongly supports a clade consisting of elephant hyrax aardvark and elephant shrew reaching bootstrap values of 99 this finding fully agrees with the only other presently available sequence data sets that include these taxa those of von willebrand factor and interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein and suggests that this extended paenungulate clade is one of the most conspicuous superordinal groupings in eutherian phylogeny some support was obtained for an artiodactylperissodactyl clade while the grouping of pholidotes with edentates was contradicted
E,arabidopsis thaliana arabidopsis is unique among plant model organisms in having a small genome 130-140 mb excellent physical and genetic maps and little repetitive dna here we report the sequence of chromosome 2 from the columbia ecotype in two gap-free assemblies contigs of 36 and 16 megabases mb the latter represents the longest published stretch of uninterrupted dna sequence assembled from any organism to date chromosome 2 represents 15 of the genome and encodes 4037 genes 49 of which have no predicted function roughly 250 tandem gene duplications were found in addition to large-scale duplications of about 05 and 45 mb between chromosomes 2 and 1 and between chromosomes 2 and 4 respectively sequencing of nearly 2 mb within the genetically defined centromere revealed a low density of recognizable genes and a high density and diverse range of vestigial and presumably inactive mobile elements more unexpected is what appears to be a recent insertion of a continuous stretch of 75 of the mitochondrial genome into chromosome 2
B,a gene encoding glucose dehydrogenase of bacillus megaterium m1286 was isolated from a lambda-embl3 phage library it is transcribed and translated in cells of the heterologous organism escherichia coli by own control regions the gene is located on a 1126-bp hindiii fragment its nucleotide sequence contains 220 bp in the 5' non-coding region 783 bp in the coding region and 123 bp in the 3' non-coding region the amino acid sequence as deduced from the coding region consists of 261 amino acids and is different from the known protein sequence of glucose dehydrogenase from b megaterium m1286 jany k d ulmer w frschle m 38 pfleiderer g 1984 febs lett 165 6-10 by using this gene as a hybridization probe a second glucose dehydrogenase gene was isolated which was also directly expressed in e coli additionally a dna region with extended sequence homology to the hybridization probe was identified this work indicates the existence of at least two independent glucose dehydrogenase genes in b megaterium m1286 homologies in the primary structures of the two different glucose dehydrogenases of b megaterium m1286 and of the corresponding bacillus subtilis enzyme are discussed
B,background a new type of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa designated community-acquired mrsa is becoming increasingly noticeable in the community some strains of which cause fatal infections in otherwise healthy individuals by contrast with hospital-acquired mrsa community-acquired mrsa is more susceptible to non b-lactam antibiotics we investigated the high virulence potential of certain strains of this bacterium methods we ascertained the whole genome sequence of mw2 a strain of community-acquired mrsa by shotgun cloning and sequencing mw2 caused fatal septicaemia and septic arthritis in a 16-month-old girl in north dakota usa in 1998 the genome of this strain was compared with those of hospital-acquired mrsa strains including n315 and mu50 findings meticillin resistance gene meca in mw2 was carried by a novel allelic form type iva of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec sccmec by contrast with type ii in n315 and mu50 type iva sccmec did not carry any of the multiple antibiotic resistance genes reported in type ii sccmec by contrast 19 additional virulence genes were recorded in the mw2 genome all but two of these virulence genes were noted in four of the seven genomic islands of mw2 interpretation mw2 carried a range of virulence and resistance genes that was distinct from those displayed on the chromosomes of extant s aureus strains most genes were carried by specific allelic forms of genomic islands in the mw2 chromosome the combination of allelic forms of genomic islands is the genetic basis that determines the pathogenicity of medically important phenotypes of s aureus including those of community-acquired mrsa strains
B,bacillus cereus is an opportunistic pathogen causing food poisoning manifested by diarrhoeal or emetic syndromes it is closely related to the animal and human pathogen bacillus anthracis and the insect pathogen bacillus thuringiensis the former being used as a biological weapon and the latter as a pesticide b anthracis and b thuringiensis are readily distinguished from b cereus by the presence of plasmid-borne specific toxins b anthracis and b thuringiensis and capsule b anthracis but phylogenetic studies based on the analysis of chromosomal genes bring controversial results and it is unclear whether b cereus b anthracis and b thuringiensis are varieties of the same species or different species here we report the sequencing and analysis of the type strain b cereus atcc 14579 the complete genome sequence of b cereus atcc 14579 together with the gapped genome of b anthracis a2012 enables us to perform comparative analysis and hence to identify the genes that are conserved between b cereus and b anthracis and the genes that are unique for each species we use the former to clarify the phylogeny of the cereus group and the latter to determine plasmid-independent species-specific markers
B,ralstonia solanacearum is a devastating soil-borne plant pathogen with a global distribution and an unusually wide host range it is a model system for the dissection of molecular determinants governing pathogenicity we present here the complete genome sequence and its analysis of strain gmi1000 the 58-megabase mb genome is organized into two replicons a 37-mb chromosome and a 21-mb megaplasmid both replicons have a mosaic structure providing evidence for the acquisition of genes through horizontal gene transfer regions containing genetically mobile elements associated with the percentage of gc bias may have an important function in genome evolution the genome encodes many proteins potentially associated with a role in pathogenicity in particular many putative attachment factors were identified the complete repertoire of type iii secreted effector proteins can be studied over 40 candidates were identified comparison with other genomes suggests that bacterial plant pathogens and animal pathogens harbour distinct arrays of specialized type iii-dependent effectors
E,bardet-biedl syndrome bbs is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder with the primary clinical features of obesity pigmented retinopathy polydactyly hypogenitalism mental retardation and renal anomalies associated features of the disorder include diabetes mellitus hypertension and congenital heart disease there are six known bbs loci mapping to chromosomes 2 3 11 15 16 and 20 the bbs2 locus was initially mapped to an 18 cm interval on chromosome 16q21 with a large inbred bedouin kindred further analysis of the bedouin population allowed for the fine mapping of this locus to a 2 cm region distal to marker d16s408 physical mapping and sequence analysis of this region resulted in the identification of a number of known genes and expressed sequence tag clusters mutation screening of a novel gene bbs2 with a wide pattern of tissue expression revealed homozygous mutations in two inbred pedigrees including the large bedouin kindred used to initially identify the bbs2 locus in addition mutations were found in three of 18 unrelated bbs probands from small nuclear families
E,dysfunction and downregulation of dad defending against death has been linked to programmed cell death pcd in animals and plants as dad is an essential subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase that is located in the er membrane the results have raised the possibility that downregulation of n-linked glycosylation could be involved in the regulation of pcd here we show that the 16 kda subunit of phytepsin a vacuolar proteinase is normally processed and glycosylated at the onset of dna fragmentation in germinating barley scutella two cdna clones encoding dad dad1 dad2 and one cdna encoding another subunit of the same oligosaccharyltransferase complex ost1 were isolated from barley northern analysis of germinating scutella show that the expression of only dad1 is declining before onset of dna fragmentation in contrast to this the expression of both dad2 and ost1 increase before onset of dna fragmentation
E,dolichol-phosphate-mannose dol-p-man serves as a donor of mannosyl residues in major eukaryotic glycoconjugates it donates four mannosyl residues in the n-linked oligosaccharide precursor and all three mannosyl residues in the core of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor in yeasts it also donates one mannose to the o-linked oligosaccharide the yeast dpm1 gene encodes a dol-p-man synthase that is a transmembrane protein expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum we cloned human and mouse homologues of dpm1 termed hdpm1 and mdpm1 respectively both of which encode proteins of 260 amino acids having 30 amino acid identity with yeast dpm1 protein but lacking a hydrophobic transmembrane domain which exists in the yeast synthase human and mouse dpm1 cdna restored dol-p-man synthesis in mouse thy-1-deficient mutant class e cells mouse class e mutant cells had an inactivating mutation in the mdpm1 gene indicating that mdpm1 is the gene for class e mutant in contrast hdpm1 and mdpm1 cdna did not complement another dol-p-man synthesis mutant hamster lec15 cells whereas yeast dpm1 restored both mutants therefore in contrast to yeast mammalian cells require hdpm1mdpm1 protein and a product of another gene that is defective in lec15 mutant cells for synthesis of dol-p-man
E,we have cloned a new gene cbl-b with homology to the c-cbl proto-oncogene a large protein is predicted approx mw 108000 that has a proline rich domain a nuclear localization signal a c3hc4 zinc finger and a putative leucine zipper there is striking nucleotide and amino acid homology to the c-cbl proto-oncogene most notably in the structural motifs described above cbl-b is expressed in normal and malignant mammary epithelial cells in a variety of normal tissues and in hematopoietic tissue and cell lines cbl-b expressions is up-regulated with macrophagemonocyte differentiation of the hl60 and u937 cell lines there is direct association of the cbl-b protein with the src homology 3 domains of several proteins including signaling cytoskeletal and adaptor proteins our data suggest that cbl-b encodes a protein which can interact with signal transduction proteins to regulate their function or to be regulated by them together cbl-b and c-cbl are members of a novel family of proto-oncogenes involved in signal transduction
B,pseudomonas putida is a metabolically versatile saprophytic soil bacterium that has been certified as a biosafety host for the cloning of foreign genes the bacterium also has considerable potential for biotechnological applications sequence analysis of the 618 mb genome of strain kt2440 reveals diverse transport and metabolic systems although there is a high level of genome conservation with the pathogenic pseudomonad pseudomonas aeruginosa 85 of the predicted coding regions are shared key virulence factors including exotoxin a and type iii secretion systems are absent analysis of the genome gives insight into the non-pathogenic nature of p putida and points to potential new applications in agriculture biocatalysis bioremediation and bioplastic production
E,three hundred cdnas containing putatively entire open reading frames orfs for previously undefined genes were obtained from cd34 hematopoietic stemprogenitor cells hspcs based on est cataloging clone sequencing in silico cloning and rapid amplification of cdna ends race the cdna sizes ranged from 360 to 3496 bp and their orfs coded for peptides of 58-752 amino acids public database search indicated that 225 cdnas exhibited sequence similarities to genes identified across a variety of species homology analysis led to the recognition of 50 basic structural motifsdomains among these cdnas genomic exon-intron organization could be established in 243 genes by integration of cdna data with genome sequence information interestingly a new gene named as hspc070 on 3p was found to share a sequence of 105bp in 3' utr with raf gene in reversed transcription orientation chromosomal localizations were obtained using electronic mapping for 192 genes and with radiation hybrid rh for 38 genes macroarray technique was applied to screen the gene expression patterns in five hematopoietic cell lines nb4 hl60 u937 k562 and jurkat and a number of genes with differential expression were found the resource work has provided a wide range of information useful not only for expression genomics and annotation of genomic dna sequence but also for further research on the function of genes involved in hematopoietic development and differentiation
E,we have cloned a novel putative serinethreonine kinase-encoding gene designed stk-1 from murine embryonic stem es cell and testis cdna libraries the kinase most closely related to stk-1 is xenopus laevis xlp46 protein kinase which shows 71 amino-acid identity to stk-1 between their kinase domains nevertheless stk-1 is conserved throughout phylogeny with hybridizing sequences being detected in dna from mammals amphibians insects and yeast stk-1 mrna is detected in testis intestine and spleen tissues that contain a large number of proliferating cells but not in other tissues all cell lines tested expressed stk-1 mrna with levels being dependent upon proliferation rates in nih 3t3 cells stk-1 is expressed in a cell-cycle-dependent fashion these findings suggest a role for stk-1 in cell growth
E,pomc is the precursor for a number of biologically active peptides such as acth alpha-msh beta-msh and beta-endorphin it is well known that some of these peptides especially beta-endorphin are involved in the regulation of reproductive functions in mammals in order to investigate the possible role of pomc-derived peptides in the control of fish reproduction we have cloned and sequenced two different trout pomc cdnas called pomc a and pomc b these cdnas exhibited limited sequence homology 44 the deduced amino acid sequences also showed weak similarity 43 despite the high conservation of some peptide sequences alpha-msh beta-msh and beta-endorphin the pomc a coding sequence exhibited an unusual length generating the longest endorphin ever sequenced the long carboxy-terminal part of the beta-endorphin a contained three potential dibasic cleavage sites allowing the occurrence of three new peptides eqwgreegee alge and yhfqg using in situ hybridization we found that the two pomc genes were expressed in the same pituitary cells pomc a mrna was the only one detectable in the hypothalamus of sexually inactive fish whereas the two pomc genes were expressed in the hypothalamus of sexually active fish these results indicate that two functional pomc genes are present in the rainbow trout in pomc neurons the expression of the pomc b gene is likely to be under the control of sexual steroids
B,brucella melitensis is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes abortion in goats and sheep and malta fever in humans the genome of b melitensis strain 16m was sequenced and found to contain 3294935 bp distributed over two circular chromosomes of 2117144 bp and 1177787 bp encoding 3197 orfs by using the bioinformatics suite ergo 2487 78 orfs were assigned functions the origins of replication of the two chromosomes are similar to those of other alpha-proteobacteria housekeeping genes including those involved in dna replication transcription translation core metabolism and cell wall biosynthesis are distributed on both chromosomes type i ii and iii secretion systems are absent but genes encoding sec-dependent sec-independent and flagella-specific type iii type iv and type v secretion systems as well as adhesins invasins and hemolysins were identified several features of the b melitensis genome are similar to those of the symbiotic sinorhizobium meliloti
E,a gene encoding the precursor for a novel member of the human acyl-coa dehydrogenase acd gene family has been isolated which maps to human chromosome 11q25 the cdna contains an open reading frame of 1248 nucleotides encoding a predicted 415-amino-acid peptide and shares considerable sequence similarity with other members of the acd family
B,countless millions of people have died from tuberculosis a chronic infectious disease caused by the tubercle bacillus the complete genome sequence of the best-characterized strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv has been determined and analysed in order to improve our understanding of the biology of this slow-growing pathogen and to help the conception of new prophylactic and therapeutic interventions the genome comprises 4411529 base pairs contains around 4000 genes and has a very high guanine  cytosine content that is reflected in the blased amino-acid content of the proteins m tuberculosis differs radically from other bacteria in that a very large portion of its coding capacity is devoted to the production of enzymes involved in lipogenesis and lipolysis and to two new families of glycine-rich proteins with a repetitive structure that may represent a source of antigenic variation
B,biochemical investigations of the muconate and chloromuconate cycloisomerases from the chlorophenol-utilizing strain rhodococcus opacus erythropolis 1cp had previously indicated that the chlorocatechol catabolic pathway of this strain may have developed independently from the corresponding pathways of proteobacteria to test this hypothesis we cloned the chlorocatechol catabolic gene cluster of strain 1cp by using pcr with primers derived from sequences of n termini and peptides of purified chlorocatechol 12-dioxygenase and chloromuconate cycloisomerase sequencing of the clones revealed that they comprise different parts of the same gene cluster in which five open reading frames have been identified the clcb gene for chloromuconate cycloisomerase is transcribed divergently from a gene which codes for a lysr-type regulatory protein the presumed clcr downstream of clcr but separated from it by 222 bp we detected the clca and clcd genes which could unambiguously be assigned to chlorocatechol 12-dioxygenase and dienelactone hydrolase a gene coding for a maleylacetate reductase could not be detected instead the product encoded by the fifth open reading frame turned out to be homologous to transposition-related proteins of is1031 and tn4811 sequence comparisons of clca and clcb to other 12-dioxygenases and cycloisomerases respectively clearly showed that the chlorocatechol catabolic enzymes of r opacus 1cp represent different branches in the dendrograms than their proteobacterial counterparts thus while the sequences diverged the functional adaptation to efficient chlorocatechol metabolization occurred independently in proteobacteria and gram-positive bacteria that is by functionally convergent evolution
E,we have cloned and sequenced the alcohol dehydrogenase gene of the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe the gene was isolated by transformation and complementation of a saccharomyces cerevisiae strain which lacked functional alcohol dehydrogenase with an s pombe gene bank constructed in the autonomously replicating yeast plasmid yep13 southern hybridization analysis indicates that s pombe contains only one alcohol dehydrogenase gene the structural region of the gene is 50 homologous to the alcohol dehydrogenase encoding genes of the budding yeast s cerevisiae the gene exhibits a very strong codon usage bias with the set of predominantly used codons generally resembling that which s cerevisiae employs preferentially all of the differences in codon usage bias between s pombe and s cerevisiae are in the direction of greater g  c content in s pombe codons it is argued that this observation supports the hypothesis that selection toward uniform codon-anticodon binding energies contributes to codon usage bias and that the optimum binding energy is on the average higher in s pombe than s cerevisiae
B,countless millions of people have died from tuberculosis a chronic infectious disease caused by the tubercle bacillus the complete genome sequence of the best-characterized strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv has been determined and analysed in order to improve our understanding of the biology of this slow-growing pathogen and to help the conception of new prophylactic and therapeutic interventions the genome comprises 4411529 base pairs contains around 4000 genes and has a very high guanine  cytosine content that is reflected in the blased amino-acid content of the proteins m tuberculosis differs radically from other bacteria in that a very large portion of its coding capacity is devoted to the production of enzymes involved in lipogenesis and lipolysis and to two new families of glycine-rich proteins with a repetitive structure that may represent a source of antigenic variation
E,pr-39 a prolinearginine-rich peptide antibiotic has been purified from pig intestine and later shown to originate in the bone marrow intending to isolate a clone for a human counterpart to pr-39 we synthesized a pcr probe derived from the pr-39 gene however when this probe was used to screen a human bone marrow cdna library eight clones were obtained with information for another putative human peptide antibiotic designated fall-39 after the first four residues fall-39 is a 39-residue peptide lacking cysteine and tryptophan all human peptide antibiotics previously isolated or predicted belong to the defensin family and contain three disulfide bridges the clone for prepro-fall-39 encodes a cathelin-like precursor protein with 170 amino acid residues we have postulated a dibasic processing site for the mature fall-39 and chemically synthesized the putative peptide in basal medium e synthetic fall-39 was highly active against escherichia coli and bacillus megaterium residues 13-34 in fall-39 can be predicted to form a perfect amphiphatic helix and cd spectra showed that medium e induced 30 helix formation in fall-39 rna blot analyses disclosed that the gene for fall-39 is expressed mainly in human bone marrow and testis
B,oceanobacillus iheyensis hte831 is an alkaliphilic and extremely halotolerant bacillus-related species isolated from deep-sea sediment we present here the complete genome sequence of hte831 along with analyses of genes required for adaptation to highly alkaline and saline environments the genome consists of 36 mb encoding many proteins potentially associated with roles in regulation of intracellular osmotic pressure and ph homeostasis the candidate genes involved in alkaliphily were determined based on comparative analysis with three bacillus species and two other gram-positive species comparison with the genomes of other major gram-positive bacterial species suggests that the backbone of the genus bacillus is composed of approximately 350 genes this second genome sequence of an alkaliphilic bacillus-related species will be useful in understanding life in highly alkaline environments and microbial diversity within the ubiquitous bacilli
E,the 14-3-3 proteins are ubiquitous eukaryotic proteins and are encoded by a gene family in many species we examined the 14-3-3 gene family in arabidopsis thaliana and found that it contains 10 members four new cdnas gf14 epsilon gf14 kappa gf14 mu and gf14 nu and two new genomic clones of gf14 phi and gf14 nu were isolated and characterized together with the six previously described 14-3-3 isoforms in arabidopsis they constitute a complete family of 10 distinct 14-3-3 proteins of 248 to 268 amino acids phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of two ancient distinct 14-3-3 gene classes in arabidopsis and other plants the epsilon forms diverged early from the other plant isoforms and plant 14-3-3 genes displayed a different evolutionary course from that of mammals
E,friedreich's ataxia is due to loss of function mutations in the gene encoding frataxin frda frataxin is a protein of unknown function in situ hybridization analyses revealed that mouse frataxin expression correlates well with the main site of neurodegeneration but the expression pattern is broader than expected from the pathology of the disease frataxin mrna is predominantly expressed in tissues with a high metabolic rate including liver kidney brown fat and heart we found that mouse and yeast frataxin homologues contain a potential mitochondrial targeting sequence in their n-terminal domains and that disruption of the yeast gene results in mitochondrial dysfunction finally tagging experiments demonstrate that human frataxin co-localizes with a mitochondrial protein friedreich's ataxia is therefore a mitochondrial disease caused by a mutation in the nuclear genome
B,many insects that rely on a single food source throughout their developmental cycle harbor beneficial microbes that provide nutrients absent from their restricted diet tsetse flies the vectors of african trypanosomes feed exclusively on blood and rely on one such intracellular microbe for nutritional provisioning and fecundity as a result of co-evolution with hosts over millions of years these mutualists have lost the ability to survive outside the sheltered environment of their host insect cells we present the complete annotated genome of wigglesworthia glossinidia brevipalpis which is composed of one chromosome of 697724 base pairs bp and one small plasmid called pwig1 of 5200 bp genes involved in the biosynthesis of vitamin metabolites apparently essential for host nutrition and fecundity have been retained unexpectedly this obligate's genome bears hallmarks of both parasitic and free-living microbes and the gene encoding the important regulatory protein dnaa is absent
A,the complete 1751377-bp sequence of the genome of the thermophilic archaeon methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum deltah has been determined by a whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach a total of 1855 open reading frames orfs have been identified that appear to encode polypeptides 844 46 of which have been assigned putative functions based on their similarities to database sequences with assigned functions a total of 514 28 of the orf-encoded polypeptides are related to sequences with unknown functions and 496 27 have little or no homology to sequences in public databases comparisons with eucarya- bacteria- and archaea-specific databases reveal that 1013 of the putative gene products 54 are most similar to polypeptide sequences described previously for other organisms in the domain archaea comparisons with the methanococcus jannaschii genome data underline the extensive divergence that has occurred between these two methanogens only 352 19 of m thermoautotrophicum orfs encode sequences that are 50 identical to m jannaschii polypeptides and there is little conservation in the relative locations of orthologous genes when the m thermoautotrophicum orfs are compared to sequences from only the eucaryal and bacterial domains 786 42 are more similar to bacterial sequences and 241 13 are more similar to eucaryal sequences the bacterial domain-like gene products include the majority of those predicted to be involved in cofactor and small molecule biosyntheses intermediary metabolism transport nitrogen fixation regulatory functions and interactions with the environment most proteins predicted to be involved in dna metabolism transcription and translation are more similar to eucaryal sequences gene structure and organization have features that are typical of the bacteria including genes that encode polypeptides closely related to eucaryal proteins there are 24 polypeptides that could form two-component sensor kinase-response regulator systems and homologs of the bacterial hsp70-response proteins dnak and dnaj which are notably absent in m jannaschii dna replication initiation and chromosome packaging in m thermoautotrophicum are predicted to have eucaryal features based on the presence of two cdc6 homologs and three histones however the presence of an ftsz gene indicates a bacterial type of cell division initiation the dna polymerases include an x-family repair type and an unusual archaeal b type formed by two separate polypeptides the dna-dependent rna polymerase rnap subunits a' a b' b and h are encoded in a typical archaeal rnap operon although a second a' subunit-encoding gene is present at a remote location there are two rrna operons and 39 trna genes are dispersed around the genome although most of these occur in clusters three of the trna genes have introns including the trnapro ggg gene which contains a second intron at an unprecedented location there is no selenocysteinyl-trna gene nor evidence for classically organized is elements prophages or plasmids the genome contains one intein and two extended repeats 36 and 86 kb that are members of a family with 18 representatives in the m jannaschii genome
E,the major groups of amniote vertebrates appeared during a relatively short time span at the end of the paleozoic era a fact that has caused difficulty in estimating their relationships the fossil record suggests that crocodilians are the closest living relatives of birds however morphological characters and molecular sequence data from living amniotes have repeatedly challenged this hypothesis by indicating a bird-mammal relationship dna sequences from four slow-evolving genes mitochondrial 12s and 16s rrna trnaval and nuclear alpha-enolase now provide strong statistical support for a bird-crocodilian relationship
E,the rna helicase gene family encodes a group of eight homologous proteins that share regions of sequence similarity this group of evolutionarily conserved proteins presumably all utilize atp or some other nucleoside triphosphate as an energy source for unwinding double-stranded rna members of this family have been implicated in a variety of physiological functions in organisms ranging from escherichia coli to human such as translation initiation mitochondrial mrna splicing ribosomal assembly and germinal line cell differentiation we have applied polymerase chain reaction technology to search for additional members of the rna helicase family in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae using degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed to amplify dna fragments flanked by the highly conserved motifs v l d e a d and y i h r i g we have detected five putative rna helicase genes northern and southern blot analyses demonstrated that these genes are single copy and expressed in yeast several members of the rna helicase family share sequence identity ranging from 492 to 672 suggesting that they are functionally related the discovery of such a multitude of putative rna helicase genes in yeast suggests that rna helicase activities are involved in a variety of fundamentally important biological processes
E,calcium-dependent protein kinases cdpks represent a new family of protein kinases which are proposed to contain in a single polypeptide both a kinase domain and an adjoining calmodulin-like domain with four calcium-binding ef-hand motifs harper jf sussman mr schaller ge putnam-evans c charbonneau h 38 harmon ac 1991 science 252 951-954 dna cloning and western blot analysis indicate that multiple cdpk isoforms are present in the model plant system arabidopsis thaliana one cdpk gene called ak1 was isolated from arabidopsis as a full-length cdna the predicted ak1 protein has a mr of 72645 and is 116 amino acid residues longer at the amino terminus than the prototype cdpk alpha gene previously identified in soybean the most highly conserved region between these two cdpks is a region of 31 amino acids that joins the kinase and calmodulin-like domains to verify the kinase activity of the enzyme encoded by ak1 a fusion of an amino-terminally truncated ak1 to the c-terminus of glutathione s-transferase was expressed in escherichia coli the fusion protein was purified and displayed a maximum kinase activity of 40 nmol of phosphateminmg using histone iiis as a substrate the enzyme activity was stimulated 3-6-fold by calcium and 2-5-fold by crude lipid however a synergistic stimulation of 16-30-fold was observed by the addition of both calcium and crude lipid lipid stimulation was specific for lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol and did not occur with the addition of phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylcholineabstract truncated at 250 words
B,the 567-megabase genome of the plant pathogen agrobacterium tumefaciens c58 consists of a circular chromosome a linear chromosome and two plasmids extensive orthology and nucleotide colinearity between the genomes of a tumefaciens and the plant symbiont sinorhizobium meliloti suggest a recent evolutionary divergence their similarities include metabolic transport and regulatory systems that promote survival in the highly competitive rhizosphere differences are apparent in their genome structure and virulence gene complement availability of the a tumefaciens sequence will facilitate investigations into the molecular basis of pathogenesis and the evolutionary divergence of pathogenic and symbiotic lifestyles
B,we present here the complete genome sequence of a common avian clone of pasteurella multocida pm70 the genome of pm70 is a single circular chromosome 2257487 base pairs in length and contains 2014 predicted coding regions 6 ribosomal rna operons and 57 trnas genome-scale evolutionary analyses based on pairwise comparisons of 1197 orthologous sequences between p multocida haemophilus influenzae and escherichia coli suggest that p multocida and h influenzae diverged approximately 270 million years ago and the gamma subdivision of the proteobacteria radiated about 680 million years ago two previously undescribed open reading frames accounting for approximately 1 of the genome encode large proteins with homology to the virulence-associated filamentous hemagglutinin of bordetella pertussis consistent with the critical role of iron in the survival of many microbial pathogens in silico and whole-genome microarray analyses identified more than 50 pm70 genes with a potential role in iron acquisition and metabolism overall the complete genomic sequence and preliminary functional analyses provide a foundation for future research into the mechanisms of pathogenesis and host specificity of this important multispecies pathogen
B,this paper describes the dna sequence of the photosynthesis region of rhodobacter sphaeroides 241 t the photosynthesis gene cluster is located within a approximately 73 kb ase i genomic dna fragment containing the puf puha cyca and puc operons a total of 65 open reading frames orfs have been identified of which 61 showed significant similarity to genesproteins of other organisms while only four did not reveal any significant sequence similarity to any geneprotein sequences in the database the data were compared with the corresponding genesorfs from a different strain of rsphaeroides and rhodobacter capsulatus a close relative of r sphaeroides a detailed analysis of the gene organization in the photosynthesis region revealed a similar gene order in both species with some notable differences located to the pucbac  cyca region in addition photosynthesis gene regulatory protein ppsr fnr ihf binding motifs in upstream sequences of a number of photosynthesis genes have been identified and shown to differ between these two species the difference in gene organization relative to pucbac and cyca suggests that this region originated independently of the photosynthesis gene cluster of rsphaeroides
E,the fly drosophila melanogaster is one of the most intensively studied organisms in biology and serves as a model system for the investigation of many developmental and cellular processes common to higher eukaryotes including humans we have determined the nucleotide sequence of nearly all of the approximately 120-megabase euchromatic portion of the drosophila genome using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy supported by extensive clone-based sequence and a high-quality bacterial artificial chromosome physical map efforts are under way to close the remaining gaps however the sequence is of sufficient accuracy and contiguity to be declared substantially complete and to support an initial analysis of genome structure and preliminary gene annotation and interpretation the genome encodes approximately 13600 genes somewhat fewer than the smaller caenorhabditis elegans genome but with comparable functional diversity
E,the suc1 protein is a cell cycle regulator whose precise function remains to be elucidated the suc1 cdna of the mollusk patella vulgata was cloned and sequenced it encodes a 9 kd protein showing a strong similarity with its human counterparts and to a lesser extend with its yeast counterparts the expression of suc1 in maturing oocytes was shown to be tightly cell cycle-regulated the abundance of the suc1 transcripts is high in prophase- and metaphase-arrested oocytes but drops dramatically upon exit from m-phase after fertilization the microinjection of suc1 synthetic messengers into embryonic blastomeres delayed the cell cycle clock thus disrupting the perfect cell cycle synchrony exhibited by the blastomeres of early patella embryos interestingly this suc1 delaying effect was significantly reversed when cyclin b messengers were co-injected with suc1 messengers these results show that patella embryos offer a quite valuable model to study cell cycle regulation moreover they support the existence of a negative control exerted by suc1 on the cell cycle traverse in a higher eukaryote
B,the 2160837-base pair genome sequence of an isolate of streptococcus pneumoniae a gram-positive pathogen that causes pneumonia bacteremia meningitis and otitis media contains 2236 predicted coding regions of these 1440 64 were assigned a biological role approximately 5 of the genome is composed of insertion sequences that may contribute to genome rearrangements through uptake of foreign dna extracellular enzyme systems for the metabolism of polysaccharides and hexosamines provide a substantial source of carbon and nitrogen for s pneumoniae and also damage host tissues and facilitate colonization a motif identified within the signal peptide of proteins is potentially involved in targeting these proteins to the cell surface of low-guaninecytosine gc gram-positive species several surface-exposed proteins that may serve as potential vaccine candidates were identified comparative genome hybridization with dna arrays revealed strain differences in s pneumoniae that could contribute to differences in virulence and antigenicity
E,the complete mitochondrial cytochrome b genes from four ground squirrels a marmot and a tree squirrel were sequenced and compared a level of divergence three times lower than expected based on fossil evidence was found between the marmot and the ground squirrels the observed divergence was similar to that found within the ground squirrels and is consistent with a recent divergence of marmots marmota from true ground squirrels spermophilus
B,here we determine the complete genomic sequence of the gram negative gamma-proteobacterium vibrio cholerae el tor n16961 to be 4033460 base pairs bp the genome consists of two circular chromosomes of 2961146 bp and 1072314 bp that together encode 3885 open reading frames the vast majority of recognizable genes for essential cell functions such as dna replication transcription translation and cell-wall biosynthesis and pathogenicity for example toxins surface antigens and adhesins are located on the large chromosome in contrast the small chromosome contains a larger fraction 59 of hypothetical genes compared with the large chromosome 42 and also contains many more genes that appear to have origins other than the gamma-proteobacteria the small chromosome also carries a gene capture system the integron island and host 'addiction' genes that are typically found on plasmids thus the small chromosome may have originally been a megaplasmid that was captured by an ancestral vibrio species the v cholerae genomic sequence provides a starting point for understanding how a free-living environmental organism emerged to become a significant human bacterial pathogen
V,sequencing of the ecori n' fragment of african swine fever virus asfv dna revealed an open reading frame encoding a protein similar to atp-dependent dna ligases when the gene encoding this protein was expressed in escherichia coli a protein of the expected molecular mass was labeled in bacterial extracts upon incubation with alpha-32patp the recombinant protein comigrated in sds-page with the putative viral dna ligase detected in extracts of infected cells we demonstrate that the recombinant protein is a dna ligase by dissociation of the protein-32pamp adduct with pyrophosphate and nicked dna the putatively adenylylated lysine in asfv is surrounded by two arginine residues instead of by two hydrophobic amino acids as in the other atp-dependent dna ligases this might explain the high concentration of pyrophosphate necessary to revert the dna ligase--amp adduct in asfv 10- to 100-fold higher than that required for other dna ligases a comparison of the amino acid sequences reported for atp-dependent dna ligases disclosed three new amino acid motifs around the adenylylation site of these enzymes asfv dna ligase has little similarity to the other enzymes at the ends of the molecule but conserves the amino acid motifs of the central region
B,leprosy a chronic human neurological disease results from infection with the obligate intracellular pathogen mycobacterium leprae a close relative of the tubercle bacillus mycobacterium leprae has the longest doubling time of all known bacteria and has thwarted every effort at culture in the laboratory comparing the 327-megabase mb genome sequence of an armadillo-derived indian isolate of the leprosy bacillus with that of mycobacterium tuberculosis 441 mb provides clear explanations for these properties and reveals an extreme case of reductive evolution less than half of the genome contains functional genes but pseudogenes with intact counterparts in m tuberculosis abound genome downsizing and the current mosaic arrangement appear to have resulted from extensive recombination events between dispersed repetitive sequences gene deletion and decay have eliminated many important metabolic activities including siderophore production part of the oxidative and most of the microaerophilic and anaerobic respiratory chains and numerous catabolic systems and their regulatory circuits
B,analysis of the 1042519-base pair chlamydia trachomatis genome revealed unexpected features related to the complex biology of chlamydiae although chlamydiae lack many biosynthetic capabilities they retain functions for performing key steps and interconversions of metabolites obtained from their mammalian host cells numerous potential virulence-associated proteins also were characterized several eukaryotic chromatin-associated domain proteins were identified suggesting a eukaryotic-like mechanism for chlamydial nucleoid condensation and decondensation the phylogenetic mosaic of chlamydial genes including a large number of genes with phylogenetic origins from eukaryotes implies a complex evolution for adaptation to obligate intracellular parasitism
E,bindin is the major protein component of the acrosome granule of sea urchin sperm which mediates the species-specific adhesion of sperm to the egg surface during fertilization bindin isolated from both arbacia punctulata and strongylocentrotus purpuratus sperm demonstrate a distinct adhesive preference for eggs of the same species although a significant amount of cross-species reactivity is observed here we describe the isolation and sequence of a punctulata bindin cdna clones and a comparison of the predicted protein sequence with the sequence previously reported for s purpuratus bindin gao et al 1986 proc natl acad sci usa 83 8634-8638 bindins from these genera show substantial sequence similarity in both the mature bindin domain and the probindin precursor region the most striking identity is a region of 42 conserved amino acids in the central part of the mature bindins this conserved domain may be responsible for conserved functions of bindin regions flanking this conserved element on both the amino and carboxyl side are more highly divergent suggesting that they are responsible for the species-specific properties of bindin the mature a punctulata sequence contains a putative transmembrane segment between residues 431 and 451 that is absent from s purpuratus bindin this structural element may account for the previous observation that isolated a punctulata bindin uniquely forms multilamellar structures reminiscent of lipid bilayers and binds significant amounts of phospholipid and detergent the structure of this hydrophobic segment also displays a number of similarities to viral fusion peptides
B,background staphylococcus aureus is one of the major causes of community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections it produces numerous toxins including superantigens that cause unique disease entities such as toxic-shock syndrome and staphylococcal scarlet fever and has acquired resistance to practically all antibiotics whole genome analysis is a necessary step towards future development of countermeasures against this organism methods whole genome sequences of two related s aureus strains n315 and mu50 were determined by shot-gun random sequencing n315 is a meticillin-resistant s aureus mrsa strain isolated in 1982 and mu50 is an mrsa strain with vancomycin resistance isolated in 1997 the open reading frames were identified by use of gambler and glimmer programs and annotation of each was done with a blast homology search motif analysis and protein localisation prediction findings the staphylococcus genome was composed of a complex mixture of genes many of which seem to have been acquired by lateral gene transfer most of the antibiotic resistance genes were carried either by plasmids or by mobile genetic elements including a unique resistance island three classes of new pathogenicity islands were identified in the genome a toxic-shock-syndrome toxin island family exotoxin islands and enterotoxin islands in the latter two pathogenicity islands clusters of exotoxin and enterotoxin genes were found closely linked with other gene clusters encoding putative pathogenic factors the analysis also identified 70 candidates for new virulence factors interpretation the remarkable ability of s aureus to acquire useful genes from various organisms was revealed through the observation of genome complexity and evidence of lateral gene transfer repeated duplication of genes encoding superantigens explains why s aureus is capable of infecting humans of diverse genetic backgrounds eliciting severe immune reactions investigation of many newly identified gene products including the 70 putative virulence factors will greatly improve our understanding of the biology of staphylococci and the processes of infectious diseases caused by s aureus
B,the d-alanine-activating enzyme dae ec 6324 encoded by the dae gene from lactobacillus casei atcc 7469 is a cytosolic protein essential for the formation of the d-alanyl esters of membrane-bound lipoteichoic acid the gene has been cloned sequenced and expressed in escherichia coli an organism which does not possess dae activity the open reading frame is 1518 nucleotides and codes for a protein of 55867 kda a value in agreement with the 56 kda obtained by electrophoresis a putative promoter and ribosome-binding site immediately precede the dae gene a second open reading frame contiguous with the dae gene has also been partially sequenced the organization of these genetic elements suggests that more than one enzyme necessary for the biosynthesis of d-alanyl-lipoteichoic acid may be present in this operon analysis of the amino acid sequence deduced from the dae gene identified three regions with significant homology to proteins in the following groups of atp-utilizing enzymes i the acid-thiol ligases ii the activating enzymes for the biosynthesis of enterobactin and iii the synthetases for tyrocidine gramicidin s and penicillin from these comparisons a common motif gxxgxpk has been identified that is conserved in the 19 protein domains analyzed this motif may represent the phosphate-binding loop of an atp-binding site for this class of enzymes a dna fragment 1568 nucleotides containing the dae gene and its putative ribosome-binding site has been subcloned and expressed in e coli approximately 05 of the total cell protein is active dae whereas 21 is in the form of inclusion bodies the isolation of this minimal fragment without a native promoter sequence provides the basis for designing a genetic system for modulating the d-alanine ester content of lipoteichoic acid
B,to obtain genes with sequence similarity to aminopeptidase t ap-t of thermus aquaticus yt-1 we cloned the genes encoding aminopeptidase th ap-th from thermus thermophilus hb8 and aminopeptidase ii apii from bacillus stearothermophilus ncib8924 the ap-th gene encoded a polypeptide of 408 amino acid residues and the deduced molecular weight of this subunit was 45015 the apii gene encoded a polypeptide of 413 amino acid residues with a deduced molecular weight of 46207 the extent of amino acid sequence similarity between ap-th and ap-t was 86 and that between apii and ap-t was 43 the substrate specificities of these expressed enzymes were similar and each efficiently hydrolyzed leucyl- or phenyl-peptide substrates since the deduced amino acid sequence of these enzymes show no similarity to other known aminopeptidases they appear to comprise an independent family of peptidases designated the ap-t family however a conserved region within the enzymes of the ap-t family shows similarity to the active site signature of the leucyl aminopeptidase family suggesting that these enzymes may belong to the leucyl aminopeptidase superfamily
E,we report in this paper the sequence of a part of chromosome xi of saccharomyces cerevisiae this 17 kbp nucleotide sequence represents the right half of cosmid pukg151 and contains nine open reading frames ykl453 450 449 448 445 443 442 441 and the 5' part of ykl440 ykl440 was previously identified as the mbr1 gene and plays a role in mitochondrial biogenesis ykl443 is a homologue of the yeast serine-rich protein srp1 while ykl453 presents strong homologies with the kin1kin2snf1 kinase family it must be pointed out that the size of this gene is well above average for yeast
E,erk7 a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family has a carboxyl-terminal tail that is required for erk7 activation cellular localization and its ability to inhibit dna synthesis to identify proteins that interact with erk7 we utilized a yeast two-hybrid screen with the cooh-terminal tail of erk7 as bait and isolated the cdna for a novel protein termed clic3 the interaction between clic3 and erk7 in mammalian cells was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation clic3 has significant homology to human intracellular chloride channels 1 ncc27clic1 and 2 and bovine kidney chloride channel p64 like ncc27clic1 clic3 is predominantly localized in the nucleus and stimulates chloride conductance when expressed in cells taken together these results suggest that clic3 is a new member of the human clic family the observed interaction between clic3 and erk7 is the first demonstration of a stable complex between a protein that activates chloride ion transport and a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family of signal transducers the specific association of clic3 with the cooh-terminal tail of erk7 suggests that clic3 may play a role in the regulation of cell growth
E,an essential component of functional genomics studies is the sequence of dna expressed in tissues of interest to provide a resource of bovine-specific expressed sequence data and facilitate this powerful approach in cattle research four normalized cdna libraries were produced and arrayed for high-throughput sequencing the libraries were made with rna pooled from multiple tissues to increase efficiency of normalization and maximize the number of independent genes for which sequence data were obtained target tissues included those with highest likelihood to have impact on production parameters of animal health growth reproductive efficiency and carcass merit success of normalization and inter- and intralibrary redundancy were assessed by collecting 6000-23000 sequences from each of the libraries 68520 total sequences deposited in genbank sequence comparison and assembly of these sequences was performed in combination with 56500 other bovine est sequences present in the genbank dbest database to construct a cattle gene index available from the institute for genomic research at httpwwwtigrorgtdbtgishtml the 124381 bovine ests present in genbank at the time of the analysis form 16740 assemblies that are listed and annotated on the web site analysis of individual library sequence data indicates that the pooled-tissue approach was highly effective in preparing libraries for efficient deep sequencing
B,dna sequences of the gene tufa encoding elongation factor tu were determined from five cyanobacteria and 21 plastids three were full-length ca 1230 bp sequences from cloned dna and 23 were partial ca 740 bp sequences from pcr fragments these sequences were aligned with sequences available from the literature creating a data set of 56 tufa sequences of eubacterial or plastid origin phylogenetic analysis was performed on inferred amino acid sequences with parsimony and neighbor joining techniques and on first and second position nucleotide sequences with maximum likelihood and bootstrapping was performed with each method trees determined by the three methods were highly congruent with respect to well supported nodes all examined plastids including those of green and red algae chromophytes and cyanophora paradoxa cluster strongly with the cyanobacteria in all analyses a cyanobacterial origin of all plastids confirms phylogenetic analyses of 16s rrna and atpb sequences but conflicts with those of rbcl and rbcs sequences this discrepancy may be attributable to an ancient gene transfer of the rubisco operon in an ancestor of red algae and chromophytes maximum likelihood analysis also provides some support for a monophyletic origin of all plastids while neighbor joining and parsimony analyses showed cyanobacteria and red brown and green plastid lineages as an unresolved polytomy these tufa analyses also provide a broad perspective on eubacterial evolution and in conjunction with published rrna trees point to at least two major radiations within eubacteria and their descendants one of many eubacterial phyla a second of cyanobacteria and possibly a third radiation early in plastid evolution
E,the gene encoding carboxypeptidase yscs in saccharomyces cerevisiae cps1 was cloned by complementation of the cps1-3 mutation the cloned cps1 gene which again enabled a leucine auxotrophic cps1-3 mutant to grow on the modified dipeptide cbz-gly-leu cbz benzyloxycarbonyl as sole leucine source was sequenced and found to consist of an open reading frame of 1728 bp encoding a protein of 576 amino acids the putative protein contains a hydrophobic stretch of 20 amino acids and a putative signal sequence cleavage site five putative n-glycosylation sites are also in the protein sequence this data is consistent with the previous finding of carboxypeptidase yscs being a vacuolar peptidase chromosomal disruption of the cps1 gene completely abolishes carboxypeptidase yscs activity this protein is yet another member of the peptidases in s cerevisiae involved in nitrogen metabolism
B,pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that is one of the top three causes of opportunistic human infections a major factor in its prominence as a pathogen is its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants here we report the complete sequence of p aeruginosa strain pao1 at 63 million base pairs this is the largest bacterial genome sequenced and the sequence provides insights into the basis of the versatility and intrinsic drug resistance of p aeruginosa consistent with its larger genome size and environmental adaptability p aeruginosa contains the highest proportion of regulatory genes observed for a bacterial genome and a large number of genes involved in the catabolism transport and efflux of organic compounds as well as four potential chemotaxis systems we propose that the size and complexity of the p aeruginosa genome reflect an evolutionary adaptation permitting it to thrive in diverse environments and resist the effects of a variety of antimicrobial substances
B,an approach for genome analysis based on sequencing and assembly of unselected pieces of dna from the whole chromosome has been applied to obtain the complete nucleotide sequence 1830137 base pairs of the genome from the bacterium haemophilus influenzae rd this approach eliminates the need for initial mapping efforts and is therefore applicable to the vast array of microbial species for which genome maps are unavailable the h influenzae rd genome sequence genome sequence database accession number l42023 represents the only complete genome sequence from a free-living organism
E,we describe the 159443-bp corrected sequence of the plastid chromosome of oenothera elata evening primrose the oe elata plastid chromosome represents type i of the five genetically distinguishable basic plastomes found in the subsection euoenothera the genus oenothera provides an ideal system in which to address fundamental questions regarding the functional integration of the compartmentalised genetic system characteristic of the eukaryotic cell its highly developed taxonomy and genetics together with a favourable combination of features in its genetic structure interspecific fertility stable heterozygous progeny biparental transmission of organelles and the phenomenon of complex heterozygosity allow facile exchanges of nuclei plastids and mitochondria as well as individual chromosome pairs between species the resulting hybrids or cybrids are usually viable and fertile but can display various forms of developmental disturbance
E,the nucleotide sequences of the maize plastid genes for the alpha subunit of cf1 atpa and the proteolipid subunit of cf0 atph are presented the evolution of these genes among higher plants is characterized by a transition mutation bias of about 21 and by rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution which are much lower than similar rates for genes from other sources this is consistent with the notion that the plastid genome is evolving conservatively in primary sequence yet the mode and tempo of sequence evolution of these and other plastid-encoded coupling factor genes are not the same in particular higher rates of nonsynonymous substitution in atpe the gene for the epsilon subunit of cf1 and higher rates of synonymous substitution in atph in the dicot vs monocot lineages of higher plants indicate that these sequences are likely subject to different evolutionary constraints in these two lineages the 5'- and 3'-transcribed flanking regions of atpa and atph from maize wheat and tobacco are conserved in size but contain few putative regulatory elements which are conserved either in their spatial arrangement or sequence complexity however these regions likely contain variable numbers of species-specific regulatory elements the present studies thus suggest that the plastid genome is not a passive participant in an evolutionary process governed by a more rapidly changing readily adaptive nuclear compartment but that novel strategies for the coordinate expression of genes in the plastid genome may arise through rapid evolution of the flanking sequences of these genes
E,green plants seem to form two sister lineages chlorophyta comprising the green algal classes prasinophyceae ulvophyceae trebouxiophyceae and chlorophyceae and streptophyta comprising the charophyceae and land plants we have determined the complete chloroplast dna cpdna sequence 200799 bp of nephroselmis olivacea a member of the class prasinophyceae thought to include descendants of the earliest-diverging green algae the 127 genes identified in this genome represent the largest gene repertoire among the green algal and land plant cpdnas completely sequenced to date of the nephroselmis genes 2 ycf81 and ftsi a gene involved in peptidoglycan synthesis have not been identified in any previously investigated cpdna 5 genes ftsw rne ycf62 rnpb and trnscga have been found only in cpdnas of nongreen algae and 10 others ndh genes have been described only in land plant cpdnas nephroselmis and land plant cpdnas share the same quadripartite structure-which is characterized by the presence of a large rrna-encoding inverted repeat and two unequal single-copy regions-and very similar sets of genes in corresponding genomic regions given that our phylogenetic analyses place nephroselmis within the chlorophyta these structural characteristics were most likely present in the cpdna of the common ancestor of chlorophytes and streptophytes comparative analyses of chloroplast genomes indicate that the typical quadripartite architecture and gene-partitioning pattern of land plant cpdnas are ancient features that may have been derived from the genome of the cyanobacterial progenitor of chloroplasts our phylogenetic data also offer insight into the chlorophyte ancestor of euglenophyte chloroplasts
B,bifidobacteria are gram-positive prokaryotes that naturally colonize the human gastrointestinal tract git and vagina although not numerically dominant in the complex intestinal microflora they are considered as key commensals that promote a healthy git we determined the 226-mb genome sequence of an infant-derived strain of bifidobacterium longum and identified 1730 possible coding sequences organized in a 60-gc circular chromosome bioinformatic analysis revealed several physiological traits that could partially explain the successful adaptation of this bacteria to the colon an unexpectedly large number of the predicted proteins appeared to be specialized for catabolism of a variety of oligosaccharides some possibly released by rare or novel glycosyl hydrolases acting on nondigestible plant polymers or host-derived glycoproteins and glycoconjugates this ability to scavenge from a large variety of nutrients likely contributes to the competitiveness and persistence of bifidobacteria in the colon many genes for oligosaccharide metabolism were found in self-regulated modules that appear to have arisen in part from gene duplication or horizontal acquisition complete pathways for all amino acids nucleotides and some key vitamins were identified however routes for asp and cys were atypical more importantly genome analysis provided insights into the reciprocal interactions of bifidobacteria with their hosts we identified polypeptides that showed homology to most major proteins needed for production of glycoprotein-binding fimbriae structures that could possibly be important for adhesion and persistence in the git we also found a eukaryotic-type serine protease inhibitor serpin possibly involved in the reported immunomodulatory activity of bifidobacteria
E,a lambda gt11 library made with cdna from the house dust mite dermatophagoides pteronyssinus was screened with human allergic serum by ige plaque radioimmunoassay this resulted in the isolation of clones coding for the major allergen der p ii the cdna coded for a 129-residue protein of 14131 daltons with no n-glycosylation sites no sequence homology with other proteins was evident the der p ii expressed in escherichia coli reacted with ige in 14 of 17 sera from mite-allergic patients giving clonal evidence for its designation as a major allergen this along with previous work has resulted in the cloning of the two major mite allergens
V,the herpes simplex virus type 1 hsv-1 tegument protein vp16 is a potent transcriptional inducer of immediate-early gene expression comprising an n-terminal domain involved in binding dna linked to an acidic transactivating c-terminal domain the gene encoding the counterpart of this protein in equid herpesvirus 4 ehv-4 was sequenced comparisons with vp16 and the homologous proteins of equine herpesvirus 1 ehv-1 and varicella-zoster virus vzv showed that a region in the n-terminal domain involved in formation of a complex with cellular proteins is partially conserved in all four proteins in contrast the c-terminal regions of the ehv proteins like that of vzv are not particularly acidic and are not significantly conserved with respect to the c-terminal region of vp16 nevertheless transient expression experiments indicated that the ehv-1 and ehv-4 proteins are able to transactivate hsv-1 and ehv-1 immediate-early promoters in a dose-dependent manner which suggests that this activity is not dependent on an acidic c-terminal domain
B,access to mineral nitrogen often limits plant growth and so symbiotic relationships have evolved between plants and a variety of nitrogen-fixing organisms these associations are responsible for reducing 120 million tonnes of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia each year in agriculture independence from nitrogenous fertilizers expands crop production and minimizes pollution of water tables lakes and rivers here we present the complete nucleotide sequence and gene complement of the plasmid from rhizobium sp ngr234 that endows the bacterium with the ability to associate symbiotically with leguminous plants in conjunction with transcriptional analyses these data demonstrate the presence of new symbiotic loci and signalling mechanisms the sequence and organization of genes involved in replication and conjugal transfer are similar to those of agrobacterium suggesting a recent lateral transfer of genetic information
B,klebsiella aerogenes strains with reduced levels of d-amino acid dehydrogenase not only fail to use alanine as a growth substrate but also become sensitive to alanine in minimal media supplemented with glucose and ammonium the inability of these mutant strains to catabolize the alanine provided in the medium interferes with both pathways of glutamate production alanine derepresses the nitrogen regulatory system ntr which in turn represses glutamate dehydrogenase one pathway of glutamate production alanine also inhibits the enzyme glutamine synthetase the first enzyme in the other pathway of glutamate production therefore in the presence of alanine strains with mutations in dada the gene that codes for a subunit of the dehydrogenase exhibit a glutamate auxotrophy when ammonium is the sole source of nitrogen the alanine catabolic operon of klebsiella aerogenes dadab was cloned and its dna sequence was determined the clone complemented the alanine defects of dada strains the operon has a high similarity to the dadab operon of salmonella typhimurium and the dadax operon of escherichia coli each of which codes for the smaller subunit of d-amino acid dehydrogenase and the catabolic alanine racemase unlike the cases for e coli and s typhimurium the dad operon of k aerogenes is activated by the ntr system mediated in this case by the nitrogen assimilation control protein nac a sequence matching the dna consensus for nac-binding sites is located centered at position -44 with respect to the start of transcription the promoter of this operon also contains consensus binding sites for the catabolite activator protein and the leucine-responsive regulatory protein
B,clostridium perfringens is a gram-positive anaerobic spore-forming bacterium that causes life-threatening gas gangrene and mild enterotoxaemia in humans although it colonizes as normal intestinal flora of humans and animals the organism is known to produce a variety of toxins and enzymes that are responsible for the severe myonecrotic lesions here we report the complete 3031430-bp sequence of c perfringens strain 13 that comprises 2660 protein coding regions and 10 rrna genes showing pronounced low overall g  c content 286 the genome contains typical anaerobic fermentation enzymes leading to gas production but no enzymes for the tricarboxylic acid cycle or respiratory chain various saccharolytic enzymes were found but many enzymes for amino acid biosynthesis were lacking in the genome twenty genes were newly identified as putative virulence factors of c perfringens and we found a total of five hyaluronidase genes that will also contribute to virulence the genome analysis also proved an efficient method for finding four members of the two-component virrvirs regulon that coordinately regulates the pathogenicity of c perfringens clearly c perfringens obtains various essential materials from the host by producing several degradative enzymes and toxins resulting in massive destruction of the host tissues
B,the 1852442-bp sequence of an m1 strain of streptococcus pyogenes a gram-positive pathogen has been determined and contains 1752 predicted protein-encoding genes approximately one-third of these genes have no identifiable function with the remainder falling into previously characterized categories of known microbial function consistent with the observation that s pyogenes is responsible for a wider variety of human disease than any other bacterial species more than 40 putative virulence-associated genes have been identified additional genes have been identified that encode proteins likely associated with microbial molecular mimicry of host characteristics and involved in rheumatic fever or acute glomerulonephritis the complete or partial sequence of four different bacteriophage genomes is also present with each containing genes for one or more previously undiscovered superantigen-like proteins these prophage-associated genes encode at least six potential virulence factors emphasizing the importance of bacteriophages in horizontal gene transfer and a possible mechanism for generating new strains with increased pathogenic potential
A,the complete sequence of the genome of an aerobic hyper-thermophilic crenarchaeon aeropyrum pernix k1 which optimally grows at 95 degrees c has been determined by the whole genome shotgun method with some modifications the entire length of the genome was 1669695 bp the authenticity of the entire sequence was supported by restriction analysis of long pcr products which were directly amplified from the genomic dna as the potential protein-coding regions a total of 2694 open reading frames orfs were assigned by similarity search against public databases 633 235 of the orfs were related to genes with putative function and 523 194 to the sequences registered but with unknown function all the genes in the tca cycle except for that of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase were included and instead of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase gene the genes coding for the two subunits of 2-oxoacidferredoxin oxidoreductase were identified the remaining 1538 orfs 571 did not show any significant similarity to the sequences in the databases sequence comparison among the assigned orfs suggested that a considerable member of orfs were generated by sequence duplication the rna genes identified were a single 16s-23s rrna operon two 5s rrna genes and 47 trna genes including 14 genes with intron structures all the assigned orfs and rna coding regions occupied 8912 of the whole genome the data presented in this paper are available on the internet homepage httpwwwmildnitegojp
E,the hla-aw19 complex consists of a number of serologically cross-reactive ag ie a29 a30 a31 a32 and aw33 which exhibit an epitope shared by hla-b and -c proteins to investigate the structural basis for these serologic cross-reactivities we have cloned and determined the nucleotide sequences for a30 a31 and aw33 and compared the predicted amino acid sequences with those already available for a29 a32 and other class i allelic products all alleles of the aw19 group contained a-locus-specific sequences exhibiting a-ness the structural similarities between aw19 polypeptides were found in the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains where shared amino acid residues were identified that correlated with observed serological reactivity patterns seven aw19-specific nucleotides were found two of these were silent substitutions but the remaining five resulted in aw19-specific amino acid residues each of the hla-a alleles can be classified into one of the five serologically cross-reacting groups in the aw19 group the alleles a29 a31 a32 and aw33 are closely related serologically as well as genetically whereas a30 probably belongs to the a1a3a11 group the similarity between a30 and the other aw19 alleles may have resulted from two independent gene conversions affecting exons 2 and 3 additional mutations or gene conversion-like events in a30 were also noted it is postulated that gene conversions have played a significant role in the divergence of the aw19 alleles however each serologically cross-reactive aw19 allotype appears to have arisen directly from a common ancestral allele a30 was the only exception and this allele may represent an unusual allotype which is subject to a high rate of genetic changes as is seen in the h-2kb gene of the mouse
B,salmonella enterica serovar typhi s typhi is the aetiological agent of typhoid fever a serious invasive bacterial disease of humans with an annual global burden of approximately 16 million cases leading to 600000 fatalities many s enterica serovars actively invade the mucosal surface of the intestine but are normally contained in healthy individuals by the local immune defence mechanisms however s typhi has evolved the ability to spread to the deeper tissues of humans including liver spleen and bone marrow here we have sequenced the 4809037-base pair bp genome of a s typhi ct18 that is resistant to multiple drugs revealing the presence of hundreds of insertions and deletions compared with the escherichia coli genome ranging in size from single genes to large islands notably the genome sequence identifies over two hundred pseudogenes several corresponding to genes that are known to contribute to virulence in salmonella typhimurium this genetic degradation may contribute to the human-restricted host range for s typhi ct18 harbours a 218150-bp multiple-drug-resistance inch1 plasmid phcm1 and a 106516-bp cryptic plasmid phcm2 which shows recent common ancestry with a virulence plasmid of yersinia pestis
B,the gene amyp coding for maltotetraose-forming amylase exo-maltotetraohydrolase of pseudomonas stutzeri mo-19 was cloned its nucleotide sequence contained an open reading frame coding for a precursor 547 amino acid residues of secreted amylase the precursor had a signal peptide of 21 amino acid residues at its amino terminus an extract of escherichia coli carrying the cloned amyp had amylolytic activity with the same mode of action as the extracellular exo-maltotetraohydrolase obtained from p stutzeri mo-19 a region in the primary structure of this amylase showed homology with those of other amylases of both procaryotic and eucaryotic origins the minimum 5' noncoding region necessary for the expression of amyp in e coli was determined and the sequence of this region was compared with those of pseudomonas promoters
E,we have isolated and characterized two diuretic hormones dh hylli-dh41 and hylli-dh30 from extracts of whole heads of the lepidopteran hyles lineata we monitored the isolation by measuring the ability of fractions to affect levels of cyclic amp production by malpighian tubules of manduca sexta maintained in vitro these dh are related to a family of vertebrate neuropeptides which includes sauvagine corticotropin-releasing factor crf and urotensin i both hylli-dh41 rmpslsidlpmsvlrqklsle kerkvqalraaanrnflndi-nh2 and hylli-dh30 sfsvnpaveilqhrymekvaqnnrnflnrv-nh2 show extremely high similarity with two dh from the tobacco hornworm m sexta this is not surprising because both h lineata and m sexta are sphingid moths the discovery of these dh provides a third example of two crf-related dh occurring in one insect species
E,the nucleotide sequence of the 948061 base pairs of chromosome xvi has been determined completing the sequence of the yeast genome chromosome xvi was the last yeast chromosome identified and some of the genes mapped early to it such as gal4 pep4 and rad1 ref 2 have played important roles in the development of yeast biology the architecture of this final chromosome seems to be typical of the large yeast chromosomes and shows large duplications with other yeast chromosomes chromosome xvi contains 487 potential protein-encoding genes 17 trna genes and two small nuclear rna genes 27 of the genes have significant similarities to human gene products and 48 are new and of unknown biological function systematic efforts to explore gene function have begun
B,an atp gene cluster from the extreme acidophile thiobacillus ferrooxidans was able to complement escherichia coli f1 unc mutants for growth on minimal medium plus succinate complementation with all four e coli f1 mutants tested was observed and subunits for the f1 portion of the t ferrooxidans atp synthase formed a functional association with the f0 subunits of the e coli enzyme in addition a hybrid f1 enzyme in which some units were derived from e coli and some from t ferrooxidans was partially functional no clones capable of complementing e coli f0 unc mutants were isolated the nucleotide sequence of the gene cluster was determined and the genes for the f0 and the f1 atp synthase subunits were found to be physically linked
E,purpose to identify clone molecularly characterize immunochemically and express functionally a bovine lens gap junction protein connexin methods the methods used were polymerase chain reaction genomic cloning rna and dna blotting bacterial expression of a fusion protein immunoblotting alkaline phosphatase treatment xenopus oocyte expression and voltage clamp technique results a bovine genomic clone encoding a polypeptide of 44424 d termed connexin44 cx44 was isolated cx44 was most closely related to the lens connexins rat cx46 and chicken cx56 the cx44 dna hybridized to a 25 kb mrna detected only in lens rna the carboxyl terminal 161 amino acids from cx44 were expressed in bacteria fused to maltose binding protein mbp the cx44mbp fusion protein reacted in immunoblots with anti-rat cx46411 to 416 antibodies and with the monoclonal antibody 5h1 but not with a monoclonal antibody to mp70 nor with antibodies to other connexins cx44 translated in vitro from the cloned dna showed a single band with an apparent electrophoretic mobility of approximately 50 kd on polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate multiple bands of 53 to 57 kd were detected by immunoblotting in homogenates of bovine lens these bands were reduced to a broad band of approximately 50 kd by alkaline phosphatase treatment suggesting that they represented phosphorylated forms of cx44 cx44 rna injected in single oocytes induced a large and characteristic time- and voltage-dependent current overexpression of cx44 produced depolarization and cell lysis junctional currents that could be regulated by transjunctional voltage were induced between paired oocytes injected with cx44 rna observations in paired oocytes suggested the assembly of hemichannels into junctional channels conclusions cx44 is a phosphoprotein component of bovine lens fiber gap junctions although it has a relatively distinct sequence it shares sequence similarity immunologic cross-reactivity and electrophysiological properties with rat cx46 these data suggest that cx44 is the protein previously identified in several immunohistochemical studies of bovine lens gap junctions that used anti-rat cx46 antibodies they also suggest that the formation of intercellular channels by pairing of hemichannels might prevent the cell lysis induced by the opening of unpaired hemichannels
E,we characterized the genes coding for the two dedicated enzymes of ethanolic fermentation alcohol dehydrogenase adh and pyruvate decarboxylase pdc and show that they are functional in pollen two pdc-encoding genes were isolated which displayed reciprocal regulation pdc1 was anaerobically induced in leaves whereas pdc2 mrna was absent in leaves but constitutively present in pollen a flux through the ethanolic fermentation pathway could be measured in pollen under all tested environmental and developmental conditions surprisingly the major factor influencing the rate of ethanol production was not oxygen availability but the composition of the incubation medium under optimal conditions for pollen tube growth approximately two-thirds of the carbon consumed was fermented and ethanol accumulated into the surrounding medium to a concentration exceeding 100 mm
E,spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 sca2 is caused by expansion of a polyglutamine tract in ataxin-2 a protein of unknown function using the yeast two-hybrid system we identified a novel protein a2bp1 ataxin-2 binding protein 1 which binds to the c-terminus of ataxin-2 northern blot analysis showed that a2bp1 was predominantly expressed in muscle and brain by immunocfluorescent staining a2bp1 and ataxin-2 were both localized to the trans -golgi network immunocytochemistry showed that a2bp1 was expressed in the cytoplasm of purkinje cells and dentate neurons in a pattern similar to that seen for ataxin-2 labeling western blot analysis of subcellular fractions indicated enrichment of a2bp1 in the same fractions as ataxin-2 sequence analysis of the a2bp1 cdna revealed an rnp motif that is highly conserved among rna-binding proteins a2bp1 had striking homology with a human cdna clone p83a20 of unknown function and at least two copies of a2bp1 homologs are found in the caenorhabditis elegans genome database a2bp1 and related proteins appear to form a novel gene family sharing rna-binding motifs
B,many insects that rely on a single food source throughout their developmental cycle harbor beneficial microbes that provide nutrients absent from their restricted diet tsetse flies the vectors of african trypanosomes feed exclusively on blood and rely on one such intracellular microbe for nutritional provisioning and fecundity as a result of co-evolution with hosts over millions of years these mutualists have lost the ability to survive outside the sheltered environment of their host insect cells we present the complete annotated genome of wigglesworthia glossinidia brevipalpis which is composed of one chromosome of 697724 base pairs bp and one small plasmid called pwig1 of 5200 bp genes involved in the biosynthesis of vitamin metabolites apparently essential for host nutrition and fecundity have been retained unexpectedly this obligate's genome bears hallmarks of both parasitic and free-living microbes and the gene encoding the important regulatory protein dnaa is absent
B,this study was designed to clone the aroa gene encoding 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase epsps from haemophilus influenzae using a mixed-primer polymerase chain reaction pcr the mixed primers were based on a back translation of previously reported blocks of amino acid homology between different cloned epsps proteins the pcr-produced probe from h influenzae dna was used to identify a recombinant lambda phage from which the rest of h influenzae aroa was subcloned and sequenced the sequence of h influenzae aroa is highly homologous to all other aroa genes sequenced to date the upstream sequence of aroa when translated results in a protein with strong homology to the purn gene product glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase the stop codon of the putative h influenzae purn gene overlaps the start codon for h influenzae aroa suggesting that the two genes may form an operon and that they may be translationally coupled
B,the comparison of the genomes of two very closely related human mucosal pathogens mycoplasma genitalium and mycoplasma pneumoniae has helped define the essential functions of a self-replicating minimal cell as well as what constitutes a mycoplasma here we report the complete sequence of a more distant phylogenetic relative of those bacteria ureaplasma urealyticum parvum biovar which is also a mucosal pathogen of humans it is the third mycoplasma to be sequenced and has the smallest sequenced prokaryotic genome except for m genitalium although the u urealyticum genome is similar to the two sequenced mycoplasma genomes features make this organism unique among mycoplasmas and all bacteria almost all atp synthesis is the result of urea hydrolysis which generates an energy-producing electrochemical gradient some highly conserved eubacterial enzymes appear not to be encoded by u urealyticum including the cell-division protein ftsz chaperonins groes and groel and ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase u urealyticum has six closely related iron transporters which apparently arose through gene duplication suggesting that it has a kind of respiration system not present in other small genome bacteria the genome is only 255 gc in nucleotide content and the gc content of individual genes may predict how essential those genes are to ureaplasma survival
B,we present here the complete genome sequence of a common avian clone of pasteurella multocida pm70 the genome of pm70 is a single circular chromosome 2257487 base pairs in length and contains 2014 predicted coding regions 6 ribosomal rna operons and 57 trnas genome-scale evolutionary analyses based on pairwise comparisons of 1197 orthologous sequences between p multocida haemophilus influenzae and escherichia coli suggest that p multocida and h influenzae diverged approximately 270 million years ago and the gamma subdivision of the proteobacteria radiated about 680 million years ago two previously undescribed open reading frames accounting for approximately 1 of the genome encode large proteins with homology to the virulence-associated filamentous hemagglutinin of bordetella pertussis consistent with the critical role of iron in the survival of many microbial pathogens in silico and whole-genome microarray analyses identified more than 50 pm70 genes with a potential role in iron acquisition and metabolism overall the complete genomic sequence and preliminary functional analyses provide a foundation for future research into the mechanisms of pathogenesis and host specificity of this important multispecies pathogen
A,we used the n-terminal amino acid sequence of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase from haloferax volcanii to design and synthesize two oligonucleotide probes that were used to identify and clone a 43 kilobase pair kbp fragment from mboi restriction endonuclease digestion of hf volcanii genomic dna the nucleotide sequence of a 15-kbp region of this clone was determined and this revealed an open reading frame that translated into a protein with good homology to dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase from other sources the first 48 amino acids were identical with the n-terminal sequence data obtained from the purified protein the complete primary structure of the halophilic dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase was analyzed in terms of its homologies to dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenases from other sources and its molecular adaptations to high intracellular ionic strength
E,the plant hormone auxin transcriptionally activates early genes we have isolated a 14-member family of dna sequences complementary to indoleacetic acid iaa-inducible transcripts in arabidopsis thaliana the corresponding genes iaa1 to iaa14 are homologs of ps-iaa45 and ps-iaa6 from pea aux22 and aux28 from soybean arg3 and arg4 from mungbean and ataux2-11 and ataux2-27 from arabidopsis the members of the family are differentially expressed in mature arabidopsis plants characterization of iaa gene expression in etiolated seedlings demonstrates specificity for auxin inducibility the response of most family members to iaa is rapid within 4 to 30 minutes and insensitive to cycloheximide cycloheximide alone induces all the early genes auxin-induction of two late genes iaa7 and iaa8 is inhibited by cycloheximide indicating requirement of protein synthesis for their activation all iaa genes display a biphasic dose response that is optimal at 10 microm iaa however individual genes respond differentially between 10 nm and 5 microm iaa expression of all genes is defective in the arabidopsis auxin-resistant mutant lines axr1 axr2 and aux1 the encoded polypeptides share four conserved domains and seven invariant residues in the intervening regions the spacers vary considerably in length rendering the calculated molecular mass of iaa proteins to range from 19 kda to 36 kda overall sequence identity between members of the family is highly variable 36 to 87 their most significant structural features are functional nuclear transport signals and a putative beta alpha alpha-fold whose modeled three dimensional structure appears to be compatible with the prokaryotic beta-ribbon dna recognition motif the data suggest that auxin induces in a differential and hierarchical fashion a large family of early genes that encode a structurally diverse class of nuclear proteins these proteins are proposed to mediate tissue-specific and cell-type restricted responses to the hormone during plant growth and development
E,the 10 extant species of emydine turtles represent an array of morphological and ecological forms recognizable and popular among scientists and hobbyists nevertheless the phylogenetic affinities of most emydines remain contentious here we examine the evolutionary relationships of emydine turtles using 2092 bp of dna encoding the mitochondrial genes cyt b nd4 and adjacent trnas these data contain 339 parsimony informative characters that we use to erect hypotheses of relationships for the emydinae both maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods yield a monophyletic emydinae in which all but three nodes are well resolved emys orbicularis emydoidea blandingii and clemmys marmorata form a monophyletic clade as do the species of terrapene clemmys muhlenbergii and clemmys insculpta form a third monophyletic group that may be sister to all other emydines clemmys guttata is problematic and probably related to terrapene based on this phylogeny and previous molecular work on the group we suggest the following taxonomic revisions 1 clemmys should be restricted to a single species c guttata 2 calemys should be resurrected for c muhlenbergii and c insculpta 3 emys should be expanded to include three species e orbicularis e blandingii and e marmorata furthermore our analyses show that neither kinetic-shelled nor akinetic-shelled emydines form monophyletic groups therefore shell kinesis was either independently gained in emys and terrapene or secondarily lost in e marmorata and c guttata parsimony paleontological evidence and the multiple origins of shell kinesis in related turtle lineages especially geoemydines support the independent origin of plastral kinesis
B,in the course of a study of genes located at min 44 of the escherichia coli genome we identified an open reading frame with the capacity to encode a 43-kda polypeptide whose predicted amino acid sequence is strikingly similar to those of the well-known dd-carboxipeptidases penicillin-binding proteins pbp5 and pbp6 the gene product was shown to bind 3hbenzylpenicillin and to have dd-carboxypeptidase activity on pentapeptide muropeptides in vivo therefore we called the protein pbp6b and the gene dacd as with other e coli dd-carboxypeptidases pbp6b is not essential for cell growth a quadruple daca dacb dacc dacd mutant was constructed and shown to grow as well as its isogenic wild-type strain indicating that the loss of any known pbp-associated dd-carboxypeptidase activity is not deleterious for e coli we also identified the homologous gene of dacd in salmonella typhimurium as one of the components of the previously described phsbcdef gene cluster
E,cryptdins are antimicrobial peptides of the defensin family that are produced by intestinal paneth cells mrnas encoding 17 cryptdin isoforms have been characterized from a cdna library generated from a single jejunal crypt six cryptdin cdnas correspond to known peptides and the remainder predict 11 novel paneth cell defensins most cryptdin cdnas have  or  93 nucleotide sequence identity overall except for cryptdin 4 and 5 cdnas whose respective mature peptide-encoding regions are only 74 and 78 identical to that of cryptdin 1 cryptdin cdnas differ at a small number of nucleotide positions frequent substitutions were found in codons 38 and 52 of the propiece and in codons 68 73 76 87 and 89 of the deduced peptides cdna clones with changes in codons 74 83 and 88 were found but there were fewer of these the antimicrobial activities of cryptdins 1 to 6 were tested against escherichia coli ml35 in two assays in an agar diffusion assay the potencies of cryptdins 1 to 3 5 and 6 were approximately equivalent to that of rabbit neutrophil defensin np-1 but cryptdin 4 was 30 times more active than np-1 in a bactericidal assay system cryptdins 1 and 3 to 6 were equally active at 10 microgramsml but cryptdin 2 and rabbit np-1 were not active at this concentration since cryptdins 2 and 3 differ only at residue 10 thr and lys respectively this amino acid appears to function in bactericidal interaction with e coli the demonstration that paneth cells express a diverse population of microbicidal defensins further implicates cryptdins in restricting colonization or invasion of small intestinal epithelium by bacteria
E,to deduce the entire sequence of the top arm of the arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 3 the sequence determination was performed on a total of 90 p1 tac and bac clones chosen according to our sequencing strategy sequence features of the resulting 4251695 bp regions were analyzed with various computer programs for similarity search and gene modeling as a result a total of 941 potential protein-coding genes were identified the average density of the genes identified was 1 gene per 4210 bp introns were observed in 73 of the genes and the average number per gene and the average length of the introns were 36 and 159 bp respectively these sequence features are essentially identical to those of chromosomes 3 and 5 in our previous reports the regions also contained 14 trna genes when searched by similarity to reported trna genes and the trna scan-se program the sequence data and information on the potential genes are available through the world wide web database kaos kazusa arabidopsis data opening site at httpwwwkazusaorjpkaos
E,a cdna clone for a novel isoform of the b regulatory subunit of type 2a protein phosphatase br was isolated from a rat brain cdna library by hybridization under low-stringency conditions with the br beta cdna fragment as a probe the novel cdna encodes a protein of 447 amino acids the identities of amino acid sequences of the novel isoform with those of rat br alpha and br beta were 80 and 85 respectively with a unique sequence at the c-terminal since this isoform is thought to be encoded by a third gene for the b regulatory subunit it was named br gamma the mrna for br gamma was 42 kb the expression level of br gamma was high in the brain and spinal cord of rats and its expression was also detected in mouse and human brains but in contrast to br beta it was not detected in the testes of rats or mice thus br gamma is though to be a brain-specific isoform of the b regulatory subunit
E,the transition from metaphase to anaphase and exit from mitosis involve the degradation of active cyclin b-cdc2 complexes by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis the anaphase-promoting complex apc catalyzes the formation of cyclin b-ubiquitin conjugates thereby targeting cyclin b for degradation the apc is composed of eight proteins including four members of a family characterized by multiple tetratricopeptide repeats tpr we mapped two overlapping expressed sequence tag clones within a genomic contig on human chromosome 5 band q31 a search revealed high homology to saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc23 a tpr protein component of the apc we have isolated the human cdc23 cdna containing the full-length predicted open reading frame the approximately 33-kb message is ubiquitously expressed and encodes a protein with 591 amino acids mw  68293 da and 9 tpr units the protein has 30 identity and 51 similarity to the s cerevisiae protein the human cdc23 gene contains 16 exons and spans approximately 31 kb cdc23 maps within the smallest commonly deleted segment in myeloid leukemias characterized by a deletion of 5q however we detected no mutations of cdc23 in leukemia cells with loss of 5q thus cdc23 is unlikely to be involved in the pathogenesis of myeloid leukemias characterized by abnormalities of chromosome 5
B,the products of the btuced region of the escherichia coli chromosome participate in the transport of vitamin b12 across the cytoplasmic membrane the nucleotide sequence of the 3410-base-pair hindiii-hincii dna fragment carrying a portion of the hima gene and the entire btuced region was determined comparison of the location of the open reading frames with the gene boundaries defined by transposon insertions allowed the assignment of polypeptide products to gene sequences the btuc product is a highly nonpolar integral membrane protein of molecular weight 31683 the distribution of hydrophobic regions suggests the presence of numerous membrane-spanning domains the btud product is a relatively polar but membrane-associated polypeptide of mr 27088 and contains segments bearing extensive homology to the atp-binding peripheral membrane constituents of periplasmic binding protein-dependent transport systems other regions of this protein are similar to portions of the outer membrane vitamin b12 receptor the btue product mr 20474 appears to have a periplasmic location it has the mean hydropathy of a soluble protein but lacks an obvious signal sequence the cellular locations and structural and sequence homologies of the btu polypeptides point to the similarity of these three proteins to components of binding protein-dependent transport systems however the dependence on a periplasmic vitamin b12-binding protein has not yet been demonstrated
E,we have isolated clones corresponding to the autosomal chorion locus of drosophila melanogaster from two distantly d virilis and d grimshawi and one closely d subobscura related species in all the species the locus is unique within the genome and encompasses the same four chorion genes and an adjacent nonchorion gene in the same order in all species the locus specifically amplifies in the ovary as in d melanogaster we present the nucleotide sequences of dna segments that total 83 kb in length and include gene s15-1 from d subobscura d virilis and d grimshawi as well as gene s19-1 from d subobscura and d grimshawi they show clearly nonuniform rates of divergence both within and outside the limits of the genes highlighted by a background of extensive sequence divergence elsewhere in the extragenic region highly conserved elements are observed in the 5' flanking dna and might represent regulatory elements
E,bullous pemphigoid bp is an autoimmune skin disease that is characterized by the presence of subepidermal blisters resulting from a disruption of the adhesive interactions between basal keratinocytes and the cutaneous basement membrane autoantibodies from patients suffering from this disorder recognize two epidermal antigens bp180 and bp230 both of which have been localized to the hemidesmosome a transmembrane structure of stratified squamous epithelia that functions in cell-matrix adhesion in the present study we report the primary structural analysis of bp180 based on the sequence of a series of overlapping cdna clones encompassing 4669 bases of the bp180 transcript a polymerase chain reaction-based protocol was used to confirm the contiguity of the cdna segments this cloned portion of the bp180 transcript was found to contain one long open reading frame orf 4596 bases in length this orf encodes a polypeptide of 155000 daltons with an isoelectric point of 97 the carboxy-terminal half of bp180 a stretch of 916 amino acids consists of 15 collagen domains of variable length 15 to 242 amino acids that are separated from one another by short stretches of non-collagen sequences located 76 amino acids upstream of the collagenous region is a putative transmembrane domain a structural feature that distinguishes bp180 from all of the well-characterized members of the collagen family this membrane-spanning domain is predicted to function as a signal-anchor sequence directing the c-terminal collagenous segment of this protein to the exterior of the cell the putative intracellular domain is highly basic with an isoelectric point of 1037 this molecular analysis predicts that the bp180 antigen is an integral membrane protein of the hemidesmosome that contains a long extracellular collagenous tail this combination of structural features suggests that bp180 may function as a cell-matrix adhesion molecule with the collagenous region acting as a potential site of interaction with basement membrane components autoantibody-mediated disruption of such an adhesive interaction may play a critical role in the development of sub-epidermal blisters in bp patients
E,objective 5-hydroxytryptamine1d 5-ht1d receptors are believed to play a major role in the vasoconstriction of vascular smooth muscle in human coronary arteries however unequivocal evidence as to which subtype of this receptor 5-ht1d alpha or 5-ht1d beta is involved in these vasoconstrictory effects is lacking the aim of this study was to identify in the dog the 5-ht1d receptor subtype encoding mrnas expressed in several large coronary arteries and in the saphenous vein methods degenerate oligonucleotide primers that selectively recognized only mammalian 5-ht1d alpha and 5-ht1d beta receptor sequences were used in rt-pcr experiments to study 5-ht1d receptor subtype expression in endothelium-denuded saphenous vein and large coronary arteries from beagle and alsatian dogs resulting pcr products were analysed and identified by southern blots and sequencing results an identical pcr product whose sequence closely resembles that of the human 5-ht1d beta receptor 98 amino acid identity was obtained from reverse-transcribed rna isolated from either saphenous vein or coronary arteries irrespective of dog race absence of 5-ht1d alpha expression was confirmed by southern blot analysis control experiments using canine genomic dna as template illustrated nonetheless that the primers chosen could amplify both 5-ht1d alpha and 5-ht1d beta sequences conclusion using rt-pcr we isolated from dog vascular smooth muscle a cdna fragment whose nucleotide sequence would encode a previously-unreported canine homologue of the 5-ht1d beta receptor we illustrated that this subtype is the only 5-ht1d receptor subtype expressed in dog saphenous vein and large coronary arteries the implications of these findings are discussed in light of results from functional studies of 5-ht1-like receptor-mediated effects in these canine blood vessels
B,sinorhizobium meliloti is an alpha-proteobacterium that forms agronomically important n2-fixing root nodules in legumes we report here the complete sequence of the largest constituent of its genome a 627 gc-rich 3654135-bp circular chromosome annotation allowed assignment of a function to 59 of the 3341 predicted protein-coding orfs the rest exhibiting partial weak or no similarity with any known sequence unexpectedly the level of reiteration within this replicon is low with only two genes duplicated with more than 90 nucleotide sequence identity transposon elements accounting for 22 of the sequence and a few hundred short repeated palindromic motifs rime1 rime2 and c widespread over the chromosome three regions with a significantly lower gc content are most likely of external origin detailed annotation revealed that this replicon contains all housekeeping genes except two essential genes that are located on psymb amino acidpeptide transport and degradation and sugar metabolism appear as two major features of the s meliloti chromosome the presence in this replicon of a large number of nucleotide cyclases with a peculiar structure as well as of genes homologous to virulence determinants of animal and plant pathogens opens perspectives in the study of this bacterium both as a free-living soil microorganism and as a plant symbiont
A,the amino acid sequences of 25 archaeal retinal proteins from 13 different strains of extreme halophiles were analyzed to establish their molecular phylogenetic relationship on the basis of amino acid sequence similarity these proteins apparently formed a distinct family designated as the archaeal rhodopsin family arf which was not related to other known proteins including g protein-coupled receptors the archaeal rhodopsin family was further divided into four clusters with different functions h pump bacteriorhodopsin cl- pump halorhodopsin and two kinds of sensor sensory rhodopsin and phoborhodopsin these four rhodopsin clusters seemed to have occurred by gene duplications before the generic speciation of halophilic archaea based on phylogenetic analysis therefore the degrees of differences in amino acid sequences within each cluster simply reflected the divergent evolution of halophilic archaea by comparing the branch lengths after speciation points of the reconstituted tree we calculated the relative evolution rates of the four archaeal rhodopsins bacteriorhodopsinhalorhodopsinsensory rhodopsin phoborhodopsin to be 54310 from these values the degrees of functional and structural restriction of each protein can be inferred the branching topology of four clusters grouped bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin versus sensory rhodopsin and phoborhodopsin by likelihood mapping using bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin as an outgroup the gene duplication point of sensory rhodopsinphoborhodopsin was determined by calculating the branch lengths between the gene duplication point and each halophilic archaea speciation point we could speculate upon the relative evolution rate of pre-sensory rhodopsin and pre-phoborhodopsin the evolution rate of pre-sensory rhodopsin was fivefold faster than that of pre-phoborhodopsin which suggests that the original function of the ancestral sensor was similar to that of phoborhodopsin and that sensory rhodopsin evolved from pre-sensory rhodopsin by the accumulation of mutations the changes in evolution rate by gene duplication and functional differentiation were demonstrated in the archaeal rhodopsin family using the gene duplication date and halobacterial speciation date as common time stamps
E,we have sequenced and annotated the genome of fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe which contains the smallest number of protein-coding genes yet recorded for a eukaryote 4824 the centromeres are between 35 and 110 kilobases kb and contain related repeats including a highly conserved 18-kb element regions upstream of genes are longer than in budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae possibly reflecting more-extended control regions some 43 of the genes contain introns of which there are 4730 fifty genes have significant similarity with human disease genes half of these are cancer related we identify highly conserved genes important for eukaryotic cell organization including those required for the cytoskeleton compartmentation cell-cycle control proteolysis protein phosphorylation and rna splicing these genes may have originated with the appearance of eukaryotic life few similarly conserved genes that are important for multicellular organization were identified suggesting that the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes required more new genes than did the transition from unicellular to multicellular organization
B,the sequence determination of the entire genome of the synechocystis sp strain pcc6803 was completed the total length of the genome finally confirmed was 3573470 bp including the previously reported sequence of 1003450 bp from map position 64 to 92 of the genome the entire sequence was assembled from the sequences of the physical map-based contigs of cosmid clones and of lambda clones and long pcr products which were used for gap-filling the accuracy of the sequence was guaranteed by analysis of both strands of dna through the entire genome the authenticity of the assembled sequence was supported by restriction analysis of long pcr products which were directly amplified from the genomic dna using the assembled sequence data to predict the potential protein-coding regions analysis of open reading frames orfs analysis by the genemark program and similarity search to databases were performed as a result a total of 3168 potential protein genes were assigned on the genome in which 145 46 were identical to reported genes and 1257 396 and 340 108 showed similarity to reported and hypothetical genes respectively the remaining 1426 450 had no apparent similarity to any genes in databases among the potential protein genes assigned 128 were related to the genes participating in photosynthetic reactions the sum of the sequences coding for potential protein genes occupies 87 of the genome length by adding rrna and trna genes therefore the genome has a very compact arrangement of protein- and rna-coding regions a notable feature on the gene organization of the genome was that 99 orfs which showed similarity to transposase genes and could be classified into 6 groups were found spread all over the genome and at least 26 of them appeared to remain intact the result implies that rearrangement of the genome occurred frequently during and after establishment of this species
E,adrenocorticotropin and beta-lipotropin have been isolated and purified from elephant pituitary glands the primary structures of these two hormones were determined by amino acid and sequence analyses of enzymatically cleaved peptides from the hormones peptide purification involved the use of gel filtration reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and paper electrophoresis
E,cattle were divided into three groups according to the red cell-protein 42 p42 phenotypes p4276 p4275 and p4 27675 whose red cells contained mr 76000 p4276 75000 p4 275 and both 76000 and 75000 isoforms respectively to elucidate the molecular basis that underlies the diversity of p42 the gene structures of bovine p4276 and p4275 were investigated two p42 cdna clones were isolated from bone-marrow cdnas of the animal with the p427675 phenotype these were identical in size 22 kb encoding major erythroid p42 with 687 amino acids but were different in three nucleotides resulting in changes of amino acids at the 599th 601st and 627th residues analysis of genomic dna from the three phenotypes demonstrated that these two clones were derived from gene transcripts by which p4276 andor p4275 were produced in vitro transcription and translation of p4276 and p4275 cdnas indeed generated p4276 and p4275 identical in size to the red-cell proteins these findings demonstrated that polymorphism of the p42 gene at codons 599 601 and 627 of p42 cdna was the cause of the molecular diversity of bovine red-cell p42 although distinct electrophoretic mobilities suggested a structural difference in the two isoforms this polymorphism appeared to have little effect at least on p42 association with band 3 since no significant difference was observed in the amount of p42 relative to total membrane proteins despite the phenotype difference for p42
V,we have determined the nucleotide sequence of the 16059-bp hindiii d fragment from vaccinia virus strain wr translation in all 6 reading frames reveals a set of 22 open reading frames orfs which are capable of encoding proteins ranging from 61 to 844 amino acids in length with one exception orf 12 we have divided them into two primary sets according to their size the minor group contains eight members ranging in length from 61 to 84 amino acids the major group has thirteen members varying from 146 to 844 amino acids in length and in addition due to its location on the dna one small orf 61 amino acids long the neighboring major orfs are closely packed along the dna being separated by 42 or fewer base pairs in several instances the ends of adjoining orfs overlap for up to 11 triplet codons in three cases 1 or 2 bases are shared between translation start and stop signals in adjacent orfs regions of both strands of the dna are transcribed two sets of temperature-sensitive mutations totaling 17 which map to the hindiii d fragment have been combined into eight complementation groups the results of marker rescue analysis map one or more member of each group to a site in the hindiii d fragment within a defined open reading frame
B,as part of the bacillus subtilis genome sequencing project we have determined a 283 kb contiguous sequence from 210 degrees to 232 degrees of the b subtilis genome this region contains the 48 kb skin element which is excised during sporulation by a site-specific recombinase in this region 310 complete orfs and one trna gene were identified 66 orfs have been sequenced and characterized previously by other workers eg acc ans bfm blt bmr come comg dnak rpod and sin operons cwia gpr and lysa genes many sporulation genes and operons spo0a spoiia spoiim spoiip spoiiia spoiiic spoivb spoivca spoivcb and spova etc the products of 84 orfs were found to display significant similarity to proteins with known function in data banks eg proteins involved in nucleotide metabolism lipid biosynthesis amino acid transport abc transporter phosphate-specific transport the glycine cleavage system the two-component regulatory system cell wall autolysis ferric uptake and sporulation however the functions of more than half of the orfs 52 160 orfs are still unknown in the skin element containing 60 orfs 32 orfs 53 encode proteins which have significant homology to gene products of the b subtilis temperate phage phi 105 andor the defective phage pbsx
B,background staphylococcus aureus is one of the major causes of community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections it produces numerous toxins including superantigens that cause unique disease entities such as toxic-shock syndrome and staphylococcal scarlet fever and has acquired resistance to practically all antibiotics whole genome analysis is a necessary step towards future development of countermeasures against this organism methods whole genome sequences of two related s aureus strains n315 and mu50 were determined by shot-gun random sequencing n315 is a meticillin-resistant s aureus mrsa strain isolated in 1982 and mu50 is an mrsa strain with vancomycin resistance isolated in 1997 the open reading frames were identified by use of gambler and glimmer programs and annotation of each was done with a blast homology search motif analysis and protein localisation prediction findings the staphylococcus genome was composed of a complex mixture of genes many of which seem to have been acquired by lateral gene transfer most of the antibiotic resistance genes were carried either by plasmids or by mobile genetic elements including a unique resistance island three classes of new pathogenicity islands were identified in the genome a toxic-shock-syndrome toxin island family exotoxin islands and enterotoxin islands in the latter two pathogenicity islands clusters of exotoxin and enterotoxin genes were found closely linked with other gene clusters encoding putative pathogenic factors the analysis also identified 70 candidates for new virulence factors interpretation the remarkable ability of s aureus to acquire useful genes from various organisms was revealed through the observation of genome complexity and evidence of lateral gene transfer repeated duplication of genes encoding superantigens explains why s aureus is capable of infecting humans of diverse genetic backgrounds eliciting severe immune reactions investigation of many newly identified gene products including the 70 putative virulence factors will greatly improve our understanding of the biology of staphylococci and the processes of infectious diseases caused by s aureus
B,regulation of the gene fima encoding the major fimbrial subunit of s typhimurium s6704 was examined by using a lambda fima-lacz lysogen transformation of the lambda fima-lacz lysogen with various derivatives of the recombinant plasmid that encodes type 1 fimbrial expression pisf101 indicated that two regions of this plasmid alter beta-galactosidase production one plasmid is a deletion resulting in the loss of a 28-kda polypeptide downstream of fima while the other plasmid encodes a 24- and a 27-kda polypeptide northern rna blot analyses indicated that the steady-state fima mrna levels of these transformants were high in addition phenotypic expression of type 1 fimbriae by agar-grown cultures is observed only in those transformants bearing plasmids which show increased beta-galactosidase and fima mrna levels
E,dystonia musculorum dt is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease in mice that leads to a sensory ataxia we describe cloning of a candidate dt gene dystonin that is predominantly expressed in the dorsal root ganglia and other sites of neurodegeneration in dt mice dystonin encodes an n-terminal actin binding domain and a c-terminal portion comprised of the hemidesmosomal protein bullous pemphigoid antigen 1 bpag1 dt and bpag1 are part of the same transcription unit which is partially deleted in a transgenic strain of mice tg4 that harbours an insertional mutation at the dt locus and in mice that carry a spontaneous dt mutation dtalb we also demonstrate abnormal dystonin transcripts in a second dt mutant dt24j we conclude that mutations in the dystonin gene are the primary genetic lesion in dt mice
B,the 567-megabase genome of the plant pathogen agrobacterium tumefaciens c58 consists of a circular chromosome a linear chromosome and two plasmids extensive orthology and nucleotide colinearity between the genomes of a tumefaciens and the plant symbiont sinorhizobium meliloti suggest a recent evolutionary divergence their similarities include metabolic transport and regulatory systems that promote survival in the highly competitive rhizosphere differences are apparent in their genome structure and virulence gene complement availability of the a tumefaciens sequence will facilitate investigations into the molecular basis of pathogenesis and the evolutionary divergence of pathogenic and symbiotic lifestyles
E,the complete covalent structure of dihydrofolate reductase from chicken liver is described the s-carboxymethylated protein was subjected to cleavage by cyanogen bromide which produced five fragments fragment cb2 contained an internal homoserine residue which was not cleaved by cyanogen bromide sequences and ordering of the cyanogen bromide fragments were established by means of automated sequencer analyses of the fragments and from smaller peptides generated by proteolysis with trypsin and staphylococcal protease the covalent structure of the single polypeptide chain comprises 189 residues of molecular weight 21651 the chicken liver enzyme is homologous to that from l1210 cells and shows regions of homology to dihydrofolate reductases from streptococcus faecium escherichia coli and lactobacillus casei these homologous regions in the chicken liver enzyme are primarily related to conserved amino acid residues implicated in the binding of nadph and methotrexate by bacterial dihydrofolate reductases
E,a mouse cdna clone has been isolated that contains the complete coding region of a protein highly homologous to the delta subunit of the torpedo acetylcholine receptor acchor the cdna library was constructed in the vector lambda 10 from membrane-associated polya rna from bc3h-1 mouse cells surprisingly the delta clone was selected by hybridization with cdna encoding the gamma subunit of the torpedo acchor the nucleotide sequence of the mouse cdna clone contains an open reading frame of 520 amino acids this amino acid sequence exhibits 59 and 50 sequence homology to the torpedo acchor delta and gamma subunits respectively however the mouse nucleotide sequence has several stretches of high homology with the torpedo gamma subunit cdna but not with delta the mouse protein has the same general structural features as do the torpedo subunits it is encoded by a 33-kilobase mrna there is probably only one but at most two chromosomal genes coding for this or closely related sequences
E,weighting strategies in a total evidence approach are often conducted in order to remove homoplasy with the implicit hope to increase congruence between data partitions incongruence was measured using the test of farris et al j s farris m kllersj a g kluge and c bult 1995 cladistics 10 315-319 within and between three mitochondrial genes from pitvipers crotalinae in partitioning each codon position for the coding genes incongruence between codon positions of a gene can be worse than incongruence between genes at analogous positions third positions of codons behave very differently in terms of incongruence from one gene to another while showing similar patterns in saturation tests instead of removing characters in order to discard homoplasy which is hopeless and does not increase general congruence we advocate for the removal of those substitutions that are incongruent with the rest the genus calloselasma and its sister group the genus hypnale are the most basal crotalinae asiatic pitvipers are paraphyletic while american pitvipers are monophyletic

B,the bacterium escherichia coli o157h7 is a worldwide threat to public health and has been implicated in many outbreaks of haemorrhagic colitis some of which included fatalities caused by haemolytic uraemic syndrome close to 75000 cases of o157h7 infection are now estimated to occur annually in the united states the severity of disease the lack of effective treatment and the potential for large-scale outbreaks from contaminated food supplies have propelled intensive research on the pathogenesis and detection of e coli o157h7 ref 4 here we have sequenced the genome of e coli o157h7 to identify candidate genes responsible for pathogenesis to develop better methods of strain detection and to advance our understanding of the evolution of e coli through comparison with the genome of the non-pathogenic laboratory strain e coli k-12 ref 5 we find that lateral gene transfer is far more extensive than previously anticipated in fact 1387 new genes encoded in strain-specific clusters of diverse sizes were found in o157h7 these include candidate virulence factors alternative metabolic capacities several prophages and other new functions--all of which could be targets for surveillance
E,the dermaseptins are a family of broad spectrum antimicrobial peptides 27-34 amino acids long involved in the defense of the naked skin of frogs against microbial invasion they are the first vertebrate peptides to show lethal effects against the filamentous fungi responsible for severe opportunistic infections accompanying immunodeficiency syndrome and the use of immunosuppressive agents a cdna library was constructed from skin polya rna of the arboreal frog phyllomedusa bicolor and screened with an oligonucleotide probe complementary to the cooh terminus of dermaseptin b several clones contained a full-length dna copy of a 443-nucleotide mrna that encoded a 78-residue dermaseptin b precursor protein the deduced precursor contained a putative signal sequence at the nh2 terminus a 20-residue spacer sequence extremely rich 60 in glutamic and aspartic acids and a single copy of a dermaseptin b progenitor sequence at the cooh terminus one clone contained a complete copy of adenoregulin a 33-residue peptide reported to enhance the binding of agonists to the a1 adenosine receptor the mrnas encoding adenoregulin and dermaseptin b were very similar 70 and 75 nucleotide identities between the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions respectively 91 amino acid identity between the signal peptides 82 identity between the acidic spacer sequences and 38 identity between adenoregulin and dermaseptin b because adenoregulin and dermaseptin b have similar precursor designs and antimicrobial spectra adenoregulin should be considered as a new member of the dermaseptin family and alternatively named dermaseptin b ii preprodermaseptin b and preproadenoregulin have considerable sequence identities to the precursors encoding the opioid heptapeptides dermorphin dermenkephalin and deltorphins this similarity extended into the 5'-untranslated regions of the mrnas these findings suggest that the genes encoding the four preproproteins are all members of the same family despite the fact that they encode end products having very different biological activities these genes might contain a homologous export exon comprising the 5'-untranslated region the 22-residue signal peptide the 20-24-residue acidic spacer and the basic pair lys-arg
A,the hyperthermophilic euryarchaeon pyrococcus abyssi and the related species pyrococcus furiosus and pyrococcus horikoshii whose genomes have been completely sequenced are presently used as model organisms in different laboratories to study archaeal dna replication and gene expression and to develop genetic tools for hyperthermophiles we have performed an extensive re-annotation of the genome of p abyssi to obtain an integrated view of its phylogeny molecular biology and physiology many new functions are predicted for both informational and operational proteins moreover several candidate genes have been identified that might encode missing links in key metabolic pathways some of which have unique biochemical features the great majority of pyrococcus proteins are typical archaeal proteins and their phylogenetic pattern agrees with its position near the root of the archaeal tree however proteins probably from bacterial origin including some from mesophilic bacteria are also present in the p abyssi genome
E,binding of antibodies to effector cells by way of receptors to their constant regions fc receptors is central to the pathway that leads to clearance of antigens by the immune system the structure and function of this important class of receptors on immune cells is addressed through the molecular characterization of fc receptors fcr specific for the murine immunoglobulin g isotype structural diversity is encoded by two genes that by alternative splicing result in expression of molecules with highly conserved extracellular domains and different transmembrane and intracytoplasmic domains the proteins encoded by these genes are members of the immunoglobulin supergene family most homologous to the major histocompatibility complex molecule e beta functional reconstitution of ligand binding by transfection of individual fcr genes demonstrates that the requirements for ligand binding are encoded in a single gene these studies demonstrate the molecular basis for the functional heterogeneity of fcr's accounting for the possible transduction of different signals in response to a single ligand
B,a five-gene cluster encoding four nonheme iron proteins and a flavoprotein from the thermophilic anaerobic bacterium clostridium thermoaceticum moorella thermoacetica was cloned and sequenced based on analysis of deduced amino acid sequences the genes were identified as rub rubredoxin rbo rubredoxin oxidoreductase rbr rubrerythrin fpra type a flavoprotein and a gene referred to as hrb high-molecular-weight rubredoxin northern blot analysis demonstrated that the five-gene cluster is organized as two subclusters consisting of two divergently transcribed operons rbr-fpra-hrb and rbo-rub the rbr fpra and rub genes were expressed in escherichia coli and their encoded recombinant proteins were purified the molecular masses uv-visible absorption spectra and cofactor contents of the recombinant rubrerythrin rubredoxin and type a flavoprotein were similar to those of respective homologs from other microorganisms antibodies raised against desulfovibrio vulgaris rbr reacted with both native and recombinant rbr from c thermoaceticum indicating that this protein was expressed in the native organism since rbr and rbo have been recently implicated in oxidative stress protection in several anaerobic bacteria and archaea we suggest a similar function of these proteins in oxygen tolerance of c thermoaceticum
E,a key enzyme in the mitochondrial beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids is the 32-trans-enoyl-coa isomerase dci ec 5338 it catalyzes the transformation of 3-cis and 3-trans intermediates arising during the stepwise degradation of all cis- mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids to the 2-trans-enoyl-coa intermediates a genomic clone encoding the human dci was isolated and characterized by use of the previously cloned human dci cdna the entire gene encompasses approximately 125 kb and the coding sequence is distributed over seven exons one major and three minor transcription start sites were determined by primer extension analysis in common with promoters of other housekeeping genes encoding mitochondrial proteins the gc-rich immediate 5'-flanking region of the dci transcription initiation site lacks typical tata and caat boxes instead two gc box consensus sequences are present introns 2 and 6 contain several alu repetetive sequences the human dci gene locus was assigned to chromosome 16 by use of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids and to chromosome 16p133 by chromosomal in situ suppression hybridization studies
B,helicobacter pylori one of the most common bacterial pathogens of humans colonizes the gastric mucosa where it appears to persist throughout the host's life unless the patient is treated colonization induces chronic gastric inflammation which can progress to a variety of diseases ranging in severity from superficial gastritis and peptic ulcer to gastric cancer and mucosal-associated lymphoma strain-specific genetic diversity has been proposed to be involved in the organism's ability to cause different diseases or even be beneficial to the infected host and to participate in the lifelong chronicity of infection here we compare the complete genomic sequences of two unrelated h pylori isolates this is to our knowledge the first such genomic comparison h pylori was believed to exhibit a large degree of genomic and allelic diversity but we find that the overall genomic organization gene order and predicted proteomes sets of proteins encoded by the genomes of the two strains are quite similar between 6 to 7 of the genes are specific to each strain with almost half of these genes being clustered in a single hypervariable region
B,the 567-megabase genome of the plant pathogen agrobacterium tumefaciens c58 consists of a circular chromosome a linear chromosome and two plasmids extensive orthology and nucleotide colinearity between the genomes of a tumefaciens and the plant symbiont sinorhizobium meliloti suggest a recent evolutionary divergence their similarities include metabolic transport and regulatory systems that promote survival in the highly competitive rhizosphere differences are apparent in their genome structure and virulence gene complement availability of the a tumefaciens sequence will facilitate investigations into the molecular basis of pathogenesis and the evolutionary divergence of pathogenic and symbiotic lifestyles
E,we used a peptide antibody to a conserved sequence in the motor domain of kinesins to screen a xenopus ovary cdna expression library among the clones isolated were two that encoded a protein we named xctk2 for xenopus cooh-terminal kinesin 2 xctk2 contains an nh2-terminal globular domain a central alpha-helical stalk and a cooh-terminal motor domain xctk2 is similar to ctks in other organisms and is most homologous to cho2 antibodies raised against xctk2 recognize a 75-kd protein in xenopus egg extracts that cosediments with microtubules in xenopus tissue culture cells the anti-xctk2 antibodies stain mitotic spindles as well as a subset of interphase nuclei to probe the function of xctk2 we have used an in vitro assay for spindle assembly in xenopus egg extracts addition of antibodies to cytostatic factor-arrested extracts causes a 70 reduction in the percentage of bipolar spindles formed xctk2 is not required for maintenance of bipolar spindles as antibody addition to preformed spindles has no effect to further evaluate the function of xctk2 we expressed xctk2 in insect sf-9 cells using the baculovirus expression system when purified recombinant xctk2 is added to xenopus egg extracts at a fivefold excess over endogenous levels there is a stimulation in both the rate and extent of bipolar spindle formation xctk2 exists in a large complex in extracts and can be coimmunoprecipitated with two other proteins from extracts xctk2 likely plays an important role in the establishment and structural integrity of mitotic spindles
B,this report describes the sequence and structural organisation of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway genes of lactobacillus plantarum ccm 1904 it also describes an in vitro technique based on pcr for sequencing without cloning this new technique was developed because it was impossible to clone certain parts of the l plantarum genomic dna in the escherichia coli host l plantarum pyr genes are organised as a 98-kb operon with the following order pyrr pyrb pyrc pyraa pyrab pyrd pyrf and pyre there are two major differences from the pyrimidine operons of bacillus subtilis quinn et al j bacteriol 266 1991 9113-9127 turner et al j bacteriol 176 1994 3708-3722 and bacillus caldolyticus ghim et al microbiology 140 1994 479-491 the absence of pyrp encoding for uracil permease and the absence of an open reading frame named orf2 whose function is unknown two mutually exclusive stem-loop structures were predicted at the 5'-end of l plantarum pyr mrna this operon could be regulated by transcriptional attenuation under the control of pyrr complementation of e coli pyrd pyrf and pyre mutants was obtained with a l plantarum genomic dna library alignment of the l plantarum pyr proteins with other known procaryotic pyr proteins indicates that they display highly conserved regions in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria
E,full-length cdna clones encoding fmo1 and fmo5 have been isolated from a library constructed with mrna from the liver of a female cd-1 mouse the derived sequence of fmo1 contains 2310 bases 1596 in the coding region 301 in the 5'-flanking region and 413 in the 3'-flanking region the sequence for fmo5 consists of 3168 bases 1599 in the coding region 812 in the 5'-flanking region and 757 in the 3'-flanking region the sequence of fmo1 encodes a protein of 532 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 599 kda and shows 833 identity to human fmo1 and 83-94 identity to other fmo1 homologs fmo5 encodes a protein of 533 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 600 kda and 841 identity to human fmo5 and 83-84 identity to other fmo5 orthologs two gxgxxg putative pyrophosphate binding domains exist beginning at positions 9 and 191 for fmo1 and 10 and 192 for fmo5 mouse fmo1 and fmo5 were expressed in e coli and show similar mobility to the native proteins as determined by sds-page the expressed fmo1 protein showed activity toward methimazole and fmo5 was active toward noctylamine in addition fmo1 was shown to metabolize radiolabeled phorate whereas fmo5 showed no activity toward phorate
E,we have developed a simple method to test whether a hydrophobic segment near the n-terminus of a protein functions as a type ii signal anchor sa in which the n-terminus faces the cytoplasm a cdna fragment containing the putative sa sequence of a target clone was fused in-frame to the 5' end of a cdna fragment encoding the protease domain of urokinase-type plasminogen activator u-pa the resulting fused gene was expressed in cos7 cells fibrinolytic activity on the cell surface was measured by placing a fibrin sheet in contact with the transfected cos7 cells after removing the medium when the cdna fragment encoded a sa the fibrin sheet was lysed by the u-pa expressed on the cell surface the fibrinolytic activity was not detected in the culture medium suggesting that the u-pa remains on the cell surface anchored via the sa in the membrane without being cleaved by signal peptidase this fibrin sheet method was successfully applied to select five novel cdna clones encoding putative type ii membrane proteins from a human full-length cdna bank
B,we have identified two new heat shock protein genes orf37 and orf35 in staphylococcus aureus located upstream and downstream of grpehsp20 dnakhsp70 and dnajhsp40 homologous genes in the order orf37-hsp20-hsp70-hsp40-orf35 the transcripts of both orf37 and orf35 were increased by thermal upshift of the culture from 37 to 46 degrees c the heat shock promoters were located upstream of orf37 and upstream of hsp40 the deduced peptide of orf37 showed similarity with those of orfa in clostridium acetobutylicum and orf39 in bacillus subtilis orf35 was unique in s aureus and has not yet been described in other bacteria
B,previous studies of erythromycin biosynthesis have indicated that a cytochrome p-450 monooxygenase system is responsible for hydroxylation of 6-deoxyerythronolide b to erythronolide b as part of erythromycin biosynthesis in saccharopolyspora erythraea a shafiee and c r hutchinson biochemistry 266204-6210 1987 the enzyme was previously purified to apparent homogeneity and found to have a catalytic turnover number of approximately 10-3 min-1 more recently disruption of a p-450-encoding sequence eryf in the region of erme the erythromycin resistance gene of s erythraea produced a 6-deoxyerythronolide b hydroxylation-deficient mutant j m weber j o leung s j swanson k b idler and j b mcalpine science 252114-116 1991 in this study we purified the catalytically active cytochrome p-450 fraction from s erythraea and found by using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that it consists of a major and a minor p-450 species the gene encoding the major species orf405 was cloned from genomic dna and found to be distinct from eryf both the orf405 and eryf genes were expressed in escherichia coli and the properties of the proteins were compared heterologously expressed eryf and orf405 both reacted with antisera prepared against the 6-deoxyerythronolide b hydroxylase described by shafiee and hutchinson 1987 and the eryf polypeptide comigrated with the minor p-450 species from s erythraea on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels in comparisons of enzymatic activity eryf hydroxylated a substrate with a turnover number of 53 min-1 whereas orf405 showed no detectable activity with a 6-deoxyerythronolide b analog both enzymes showed weak activity in the o-dealkylation of 7-ethoxycoumarin we conclude that the previously isolated 6-deoxyerythronolide b hydroxylase was a mixture of two p-450 enzymes and that only the minor form shows 6-deoxyerythronolide b hydroxylase activity
E,rat liver 5'-nucleotidase was purified from a crude microsomal fraction and its molecular mass was estimated to be 73 kda by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the purified protein was subjected to cleavage with cnbr or lysyl endopeptidase and the resulting 21 peptides as well as the nh2 terminus of the native protein were sequenced by edman degradation for further information on the molecular structure we constructed a lambda gt11 liver cdna library and isolated two cdna clones for 5'-nucleotidase lambda cntp6 and lambda cnt34 the 32-kilobase cdna insert of lambda cntp6 contains an open reading frame that encodes a 576-residue polypeptide with a calculated size of 63965 da which is in reasonable agreement with that of 5'-nucleotidase 62 kda immunoprecipitated from cell-free translation products the nh2-terminal 28 residues comprise a signal peptide which is followed by the nh2-terminal sequence of the purified protein the predicted structure contains all the other peptide sequences determined by edman degradation five potential n-linked glycosylation sites are found in the molecule accounting for the difference in mass between the precursor and mature forms another characteristic feature is that the primary structure contains a highly hydrophobic amino acid sequence at the cooh terminus a possible signal for the post-translational modification by glycophospholipid in fact labeling experiments of rat hepatocytes demonstrated that 3h-labeled compounds such as ethanolamine myo-inositol and palmitic acid components of the glycolipid anchor were incorporated into 5'-nucleotidase phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c released 5'-nucleotidase from the cell surface and the released protein no longer contained the radioactivity of 3hpalmitic acid incorporated
V,the complete rna sequence of the hepatitis delta virus hdv obtained from the nauru island in the pacific was determined by cdna cloning and amplification by polymerase chain reaction pcr the sequence showed 14-17 divergence from the two known hdv rna sequences there are three highly conserved domains the region around the autocatalytic cleavage site of the genomic rna nucleotides 659 to 772 the region around the autocatalytic cleavage site of the antigenomic-sense rna nucleotides 847 to 966 and the region around the middle one-third domain of the open reading frame orf encoding the hepatitis delta antigen on the antigenomic rna nucleotides 1267 to 1347 the two autocatalytic activities are required for the cleavage and ligation of hdv rna during rna replication the third conserved domain codes for the rna-binding domain of hdag which specifically interacts with hdv rna three nucleotide changes within the genomic catalytic sequence are present but did not alter the catalytic cleavage activity of the hdv rna microheterogeneity of the rna sequences was also detected one of these occurred within the coding region of the delta antigen creating an amber termination codon in some of the rna species thus this hdv strain contains two different rna species one of which encodes a delta antigen of 214 amino acids and the other 195 amino acids these two protein species were detected by immunoblotting of the patient's plasma in contrast to other hdv strains only three orfs capable of encoding more than 100 amino acids each are present in this hdv rna we recommend that oligonucleotides complementary to the highly conserved sequences should be used as primers for pcr in clinical detection assays of hepatitis delta virus infection
B,bacillus subtilis is the best-characterized member of the gram-positive bacteria its genome of 4214810 base pairs comprises 4100 protein-coding genes of these protein-coding genes 53 are represented once while a quarter of the genome corresponds to several gene families that have been greatly expanded by gene duplication the largest family containing 77 putative atp-binding transport proteins in addition a large proportion of the genetic capacity is devoted to the utilization of a variety of carbon sources including many plant-derived molecules the identification of five signal peptidase genes as well as several genes for components of the secretion apparatus is important given the capacity of bacillus strains to secrete large amounts of industrially important enzymes many of the genes are involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites including antibiotics that are more typically associated with streptomyces species the genome contains at least ten prophages or remnants of prophages indicating that bacteriophage infection has played an important evolutionary role in horizontal gene transfer in particular in the propagation of bacterial pathogenesis
E,dec1 is a basic helix-loop-helix bhlh protein related to drosophila hairy enhancer of split and hes and involved in the control of proliferation andor differentiation of chondrocytes neurons etc we report here the identification and characterization of human mouse and rat dec2 a novel member of the dec subfamily dec2 had high 97 and moderate 52 similarities in the bhlh region and the orange domain with dec1 respectively however dec2 but not dec1 had alanine and glycine-rich regions in the c-terminal half unlike hairy enhancer of split and hes dec2 lacked the wrpw motif for interaction with the corepressor groucho the dec2 gene was mapped to human chromosome 12p1123-p121 mouse chromosome 6 g2-g3 and rat chromosome 4q43 distal-q4 where the conserved linkage homology has been identified among these species unlike dec1 which was broadly expressed in many tissues dec2 showed a more restricted pattern of mrna expression the dec subfamily proteins may play an important role in tissue development
E,several myeloid antimicrobial peptide precursors have been shown to consist of a n-terminal proregion similar to a protein named cathelin and a structurally varied c-terminal antimicrobial domain proteins with these features have been named cathelicidins in this paper we report the cdna sequences of three ovine cathelicidins of 155 160 and 190 residues respectively with cationic c-terminal sequences corresponding to putative antimicrobial domains these are structurally varied and include a cys-rich sequence of 12 residues which is similar to the bovine antimicrobial cyclic dodecapeptide a novel 29 residue sequence named smap-29 with a possible alpha-helical conformation and a 60 residue sequence named bac75 which appears to be a new member of the pro- and arg-rich group of mammalian antimicrobial peptides
B,bacillus subtilis is the best-characterized member of the gram-positive bacteria its genome of 4214810 base pairs comprises 4100 protein-coding genes of these protein-coding genes 53 are represented once while a quarter of the genome corresponds to several gene families that have been greatly expanded by gene duplication the largest family containing 77 putative atp-binding transport proteins in addition a large proportion of the genetic capacity is devoted to the utilization of a variety of carbon sources including many plant-derived molecules the identification of five signal peptidase genes as well as several genes for components of the secretion apparatus is important given the capacity of bacillus strains to secrete large amounts of industrially important enzymes many of the genes are involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites including antibiotics that are more typically associated with streptomyces species the genome contains at least ten prophages or remnants of prophages indicating that bacteriophage infection has played an important evolutionary role in horizontal gene transfer in particular in the propagation of bacterial pathogenesis
B,the 4639221-base pair sequence of escherichia coli k-12 is presented of 4288 protein-coding genes annotated 38 percent have no attributed function comparison with five other sequenced microbes reveals ubiquitous as well as narrowly distributed gene families many families of similar genes within e coli are also evident the largest family of paralogous proteins contains 80 abc transporters the genome as a whole is strikingly organized with respect to the local direction of replication guanines oligonucleotides possibly related to replication and recombination and most genes are so oriented the genome also contains insertion sequence is elements phage remnants and many other patches of unusual composition indicating genome plasticity through horizontal transfer
B,the genus xanthomonas is a diverse and economically important group of bacterial phytopathogens belonging to the gamma-subdivision of the proteobacteria xanthomonas axonopodis pv citri xac causes citrus canker which affects most commercial citrus cultivars resulting in significant losses worldwide symptoms include canker lesions leading to abscission of fruit and leaves and general tree decline xanthomonas campestris pv campestris xcc causes black rot which affects crucifers such as brassica and arabidopsis symptoms include marginal leaf chlorosis and darkening of vascular tissue accompanied by extensive wilting and necrosis xanthomonas campestris pv campestris is grown commercially to produce the exopolysaccharide xanthan gum which is used as a viscosifying and stabilizing agent in many industries here we report and compare the complete genome sequences of xac and xcc their distinct disease phenotypes and host ranges belie a high degree of similarity at the genomic level more than 80 of genes are shared and gene order is conserved along most of their respective chromosomes we identified several groups of strain-specific genes and on the basis of these groups we propose mechanisms that may explain the differing host specificities and pathogenic processes
E,the complete mitochondrial dna mtdna molecule of the hamadryas baboon papio hamadryas was sequenced and included in a molecular analysis of 24 complete mammalian mtdnas the particular aim of the study was to time the divergence between cercopithecoidea and hominoidea that divergence set at 30 million years before present mybp was a fundamental reference for the original proposal of recent hominoid divergences according to which the split among gorilla chimpanzee and homo took place 5 mybp in the present study the validity of the postulated 30 mybp dating of the cercopithecoideahominoidea divergence was examined by applying two independent nonprimate molecular references the divergence between artiodactyls and cetaceans set at 60 mybp and that between equidae and rhinocerotidae set at 50 mybp after calibration for differences in evolutionary rates application of the two references suggested that the cercopithecoideahominoidea divergence took place 50 mybp consistent with the marked shift in the dating of the cercopithecoideahominoidea split all hominoid divergences receive a much earlier dating thus the estimated date of the divergence between pan chimpanzee and homo is 10-13 mybp and that between gorilla and the panhomo linage approximately 17 mybp the same datings were obtained in an analysis of clocklike evolving genes the findings show that recalculation is necessary of all molecular datings based directly or indirectly on a cercopithecoideahominoidea split 30 mybp
E,membrane skeleton protein 41 and other members of a family of proteins that link the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane may play an integral role in cell communication during development the polymerase chain reaction and degenerate oligodeoxynucleotide primers to consensus sequences in the putative membrane-binding domain of the protein 41 superfamily were used to isolate cdnas encoding members of the zebrafish protein 41 family zebrafish stage- and tissue-specific first strand cdna was used in the pcr after the reaction amplicons of the predicted size were sequenced to confirm their relationship to the protein 41 superfamily one cdna with a high degree of similarity to a mouse novel band 41-like cdna was used to probe a zebrafish adult brain library a 24-kb cdna was isolated and found to encode a 619 amino acid polypeptide homologous to mouse novel band 41-like protein 4 zebrafish nbl4 mrna is maternally supplied and is expressed throughout embryogenesis in adults nbl4 is found in the ovary eye heart and brain but not in gut or skeletal muscle when synthetic nbl4 mrna is translated in vitro it binds calmodulin in a calcium-dependent manner these data indicate that zebrafish nbl4 is a maternal transcript owing to its presence before the midblastula transition and it is present later on in specific adult structures the ability to bind calmodulin would suggest that the function of nbl4 protein may be potentially regulated via a calcium-calmodulin dependent mechanism
E,with the complete human genomic sequence being unraveled the focus will shift to gene identification and to the functional analysis of gene products the generation of a set of cdnas both sequences and physical clones which contains the complete and noninterrupted protein coding regions of all human genes will provide the indispensable tools for the systematic and comprehensive analysis of protein function to eventually understand the molecular basis of man here we report the sequencing and analysis of 500 novel human cdnas containing the complete protein coding frame assignment to functional categories was possible for 52 259 of the encoded proteins the remaining fraction having no similarities with known proteins by aligning the cdna sequences with the sequences of the finished chromosomes 21 and 22 we identified a number of genes that either had been completely missed in the analysis of the genomic sequences or had been wrongly predicted three of these genes appear to be present in several copies we conclude that full-length cdna sequencing continues to be crucial also for the accurate identification of genes the set of 500 novel cdnas and another 1000 full-coding cdnas of known transcripts we have identified adds up to cdna representations covering 2--5  of all human genes we thus substantially contribute to the generation of a gene catalog consisting of both full-coding cdna sequences and clones which should be made freely available and will become an invaluable tool for detailed functional studies
A,the complete 1751377-bp sequence of the genome of the thermophilic archaeon methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum deltah has been determined by a whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach a total of 1855 open reading frames orfs have been identified that appear to encode polypeptides 844 46 of which have been assigned putative functions based on their similarities to database sequences with assigned functions a total of 514 28 of the orf-encoded polypeptides are related to sequences with unknown functions and 496 27 have little or no homology to sequences in public databases comparisons with eucarya- bacteria- and archaea-specific databases reveal that 1013 of the putative gene products 54 are most similar to polypeptide sequences described previously for other organisms in the domain archaea comparisons with the methanococcus jannaschii genome data underline the extensive divergence that has occurred between these two methanogens only 352 19 of m thermoautotrophicum orfs encode sequences that are 50 identical to m jannaschii polypeptides and there is little conservation in the relative locations of orthologous genes when the m thermoautotrophicum orfs are compared to sequences from only the eucaryal and bacterial domains 786 42 are more similar to bacterial sequences and 241 13 are more similar to eucaryal sequences the bacterial domain-like gene products include the majority of those predicted to be involved in cofactor and small molecule biosyntheses intermediary metabolism transport nitrogen fixation regulatory functions and interactions with the environment most proteins predicted to be involved in dna metabolism transcription and translation are more similar to eucaryal sequences gene structure and organization have features that are typical of the bacteria including genes that encode polypeptides closely related to eucaryal proteins there are 24 polypeptides that could form two-component sensor kinase-response regulator systems and homologs of the bacterial hsp70-response proteins dnak and dnaj which are notably absent in m jannaschii dna replication initiation and chromosome packaging in m thermoautotrophicum are predicted to have eucaryal features based on the presence of two cdc6 homologs and three histones however the presence of an ftsz gene indicates a bacterial type of cell division initiation the dna polymerases include an x-family repair type and an unusual archaeal b type formed by two separate polypeptides the dna-dependent rna polymerase rnap subunits a' a b' b and h are encoded in a typical archaeal rnap operon although a second a' subunit-encoding gene is present at a remote location there are two rrna operons and 39 trna genes are dispersed around the genome although most of these occur in clusters three of the trna genes have introns including the trnapro ggg gene which contains a second intron at an unprecedented location there is no selenocysteinyl-trna gene nor evidence for classically organized is elements prophages or plasmids the genome contains one intein and two extended repeats 36 and 86 kb that are members of a family with 18 representatives in the m jannaschii genome
E,quail cystatin a new cysteine proteinase inhibitor protein of the cystatin superfamily was purified from egg albumen of japanese quail coturnix coturnix japonica amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry revealed the complete 116 amino acid residue primary structure of a phosphorylated form 13173 da the inhibitor has a 90 sequence identity with chicken cystatin its interaction with papain is rapid and tight ki  44 pm kon  18x107 m-1 s-1 koff  08x10-4 s-1 and very similar to that of chicken cystatin surprisingly however cathepsin b was inhibited 15-fold more strongly by quail cystatin ki  47 pm kon  19x107 m-1 s-1 koff  9x10-4 s-1 than by chicken cystatin ki  784 pm kon  29x107 m-1 s-1 koff  24x10-4 s-1 intuitive comparative conformational inspection of related inhibitors and of cognate enzymes suggest that i the 3d structure of quail cystatin is nearly identical to that of chicken cystatin ii quail cystatin can interact with cathepsin b analogous to the stefin b-papain interaction if the 'occluding loop' of cathepsin b possesses an 'open' conformation iii the greater inhibition of cathepsin b by quail cystatin compared to chicken cystatins probably arises from two additional ionic interactions between residues arg15 and lys112 of the inhibitor and glu194 and asp124 of the enzyme respectively the two potential salt bridges are located outside of the known contact regions between cystatins and peptidases of the papain family
E,the chloroplast albino3 alb3 protein is a chloroplast homolog of the mitochondrial oxa1p and yidc proteins of escherichia coli which are essential components for integrating membrane proteins in vitro studies in vascular plants have revealed that alb3 is required for the integration of the light-harvesting complex protein into the thylakoid membrane here we show that the gene affected in the ac29 mutant of chlamydomonas reinhardtii is alb31 the availability of the ac29 mutant has allowed us to examine the function of alb31 in vivo the loss of alb31 has two major effects first the amount of light-harvesting complex from photosystem ii lhcii and photosystem i lhci is reduced 10-fold and total chlorophyll represents only 30 of wild-type levels second the amount of photosystem ii is diminished 2-fold in light-grown cells and nearly 10-fold in dark-grown cells the accumulation of photosystem i the cytochrome b6f complex and atp synthase is not affected in the ac29 mutant mild solubilization of thylakoid membranes reveals that alb3 forms two distinct complexes a lower molecular mass complex of a size similar to lhc and a high molecular mass complex a homolog of alb31 alb32 is present in chlamydomonas with 37 sequence identity and 57 sequence similarity based on the phenotype of ac29 these two genes appear to have mostly nonredundant functions
B,the genome of the bacterium borrelia burgdorferi b31 the aetiologic agent of lyme disease contains a linear chromosome of 910725 base pairs and at least 17 linear and circular plasmids with a combined size of more than 533000 base pairs the chromosome contains 853 genes encoding a basic set of proteins for dna replication transcription translation solute transport and energy metabolism but like mycoplasma genitalium it contains no genes for cellular biosynthetic reactions because b burgdorferi and m genitalium are distantly related eubacteria we suggest that their limited metabolic capacities reflect convergent evolution by gene loss from more metabolically competent progenitors of 430 genes on 11 plasmids most have no known biological function 39 of plasmid genes are paralogues that form 47 gene families the biological significance of the multiple plasmid-encoded genes is not clear although they may be involved in antigenic variation or immune evasion
B,the genus xanthomonas is a diverse and economically important group of bacterial phytopathogens belonging to the gamma-subdivision of the proteobacteria xanthomonas axonopodis pv citri xac causes citrus canker which affects most commercial citrus cultivars resulting in significant losses worldwide symptoms include canker lesions leading to abscission of fruit and leaves and general tree decline xanthomonas campestris pv campestris xcc causes black rot which affects crucifers such as brassica and arabidopsis symptoms include marginal leaf chlorosis and darkening of vascular tissue accompanied by extensive wilting and necrosis xanthomonas campestris pv campestris is grown commercially to produce the exopolysaccharide xanthan gum which is used as a viscosifying and stabilizing agent in many industries here we report and compare the complete genome sequences of xac and xcc their distinct disease phenotypes and host ranges belie a high degree of similarity at the genomic level more than 80 of genes are shared and gene order is conserved along most of their respective chromosomes we identified several groups of strain-specific genes and on the basis of these groups we propose mechanisms that may explain the differing host specificities and pathogenic processes
A,we report the complete sequence of an extreme halophile halobacterium sp nrc-1 harboring a dynamic 2571010-bp genome containing 91 insertion sequences representing 12 families and organized into a large chromosome and 2 related minichromosomes the halobacterium nrc-1 genome codes for 2630 predicted proteins 36 of which are unrelated to any previously reported analysis of the genome sequence shows the presence of pathways for uptake and utilization of amino acids active sodium-proton antiporter and potassium uptake systems sophisticated photosensory and signal transduction pathways and dna replication transcription and translation systems resembling more complex eukaryotic organisms whole proteome comparisons show the definite archaeal nature of this halophile with additional similarities to the gram-positive bacillus subtilis and other bacteria the ease of culturing halobacterium and the availability of methods for its genetic manipulation in the laboratory including construction of gene knockouts and replacements indicate this halophile can serve as an excellent model system among the archaea
E,the sequence of the 16019 nucleotide-pair mitochondrial dna mtdna molecule of drosophila yakuba is presented this molecule contains the genes for two rrnas 22 trnas six identified proteins cytochrome b cytochrome c oxidase subunits i ii and iii coi-iii and atpase subunits 6 and 8 and seven presumptive proteins urf1-6 and urf4l replication originates within a region of 1077 nucleotides that is 928 a  t and lacks any open reading frame larger than 123 nucleotides an equivalent to the sequence found in all mammalian mtcdnas that is associated with initiation of second-strand dna synthesis is not present in d yakuba mtdna introns are absent from d yakuba mitochondrial genes and there are few 0-31 intergenic nucleotides the genes found in d yakuba and mammalian mtdnas are the same but there are differences in their arrangement and in the relative proportions of the complementary strands of the molecule that serve as templates for transcription although the d yakuba small and large mitochondrial rrna genes are exceptionally low in g and c and are shorter than any other metazoan rrna genes reported they can be folded into secondary structures remarkably similar to the secondary structures proposed for mammalian mitochondrial rrnas d yakuba mitochondrial trna genes like their mammalian counterparts are more variable in sequence than nonorganelle trnas in mitochondrial protein genes atg att ata and in one case coi ataa appear to be used as translation initiation codons the only termination codon found in these genes is taa in the d yakuba mitochondrial genetic code aga ata and tga specify serine isoleucine and tryptophan respectively fifty-nine types of sense condon are used in the d yakuba mitochondrial protein genes but 938 of all codons end in a or t codon-anticodon interactions may include both g-a and c-a pairing in the wobble position evidence is summarized that supports the hypothesis that a and t nucleotides are favored at all locations in the d yakuba mtdna molecule where these nucleotides are compatible with function
E,complementary dna clones encoding acidic and basic isoforms of tomato chitinases were isolated from cladosporium fulvum-infected leaves the clones were sequenced and found to encode the 30 kda basic intracellular and the 26 and 27 kda acidic extracellular tomato chitinases previously purified mhaj joosten et al in preparation a fourth truncated cdna which appears to encode an extracellular chitinase with 82 amino acid similarity to the 30 kda intracellular chitinase was also isolated characterization of the clones revealed that the 30 kda basic intracellular protein is a class i chitinase and that the 26 and 27 kda acidic extracellular proteins which have 85 peptide sequence similarity are class ii chitinases the characterized cdna clones represent four from a family of at least six tomato chitinases southern blot analysis indicated that with the exception of the 30 kda basic intracellular chitinase the tomato chitinases are encoded by one or two genes northern blot analysis showed that the mrna encoding the 26 kda acidic extracellular chitinase is induced more rapidly during an incompatible c fulvum-tomato interaction than during a compatible interaction this difference in timing of mrna induction was not observed for the 30 kda basic intracellular chitinase
E,the existence of evolutionary rate variation has previously been demonstrated between different orders different species and even between different regions of the same gene to examine rate variation between closely related species of rodents we have sequenced the adenine phosphorybosyltransferase aprt gene from mus spicilegus mus pahari mastomys hildebrandtii stochomys longicaudatus and gerbillus campestris and compared these sequences with the previously published mus musculus rattus norvegicus and mesocricetus auratus aprt sequences the alignment of these eight rodent aprt sequences reveals two large insertions within the introns an insertion with sequence similar to a b1 repetitive element is found within mastomys and an insertion with sequence similar to a b2 repetitive element is found within m pahari a phylogeny for the rodent aprts agrees with the previously published rodent phylogeny based on other molecular and morphological data the relative rate test which is often used to test for variation in rates of evolution in different lineages is shown here to be sensitive to the choice of outgroup and therefore should be used with great caution this sensitivity is detectable only with closely related species and results from the prevalence of homoplastic substitutions rate variation is demonstrated within the aprt exons and introns and between the rodent species with the most significant difference being a rate difference in m spicilegus in addition some third codon positions are shown to be more prone to substitution than others this clearly demonstrates that even between very closely related species there is ample evidence of major differences in rates of evolution among species among regions of the gene and among different positions within the gene we also demonstrate that standard methods of analysis might not detect this variation
B,the nucleotide nt sequence of a 1332-bp fragment of streptomyces alboniger dna containing the gene dmpm which encodes an o-demethyl puromycin o-methyltransferase dmpm has been determined the dmpm gene contains a 1131-nt open reading frame which encodes a polypeptide of mr 40303 this is consistent with the 44 - 25- and 160-kda sizes of the dmpm monomer and its native form respectively the atg start codon of dmpm is 50 bp downstream from the coding sequence of the gene pac which determines a puromycin n-acetyltransferase s1 mapping experiments indicate that pac and dmpm are transcribed on a single transcript which ends at least 500 nt downstream from the dmpm stop codon the deduced amino acid sequence of dmpm shows significant similarities to those of a hydroxyindole o-methyltransferase which is involved in the biosynthesis of melatonin by bovine pineal glands ishida et al j biol chem 262 1987 2895-2899 a hydroxyneurosporene methyltransferase which is involved in carotenoid biosynthesis in the purple nonsulfur bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus armstrong et al mol gen genet 216 1989 254-268 and two o-methyltransferases of the tetracenomycin biosynthesis pathway from streptomyces glaucescens
B,pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that is one of the top three causes of opportunistic human infections a major factor in its prominence as a pathogen is its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants here we report the complete sequence of p aeruginosa strain pao1 at 63 million base pairs this is the largest bacterial genome sequenced and the sequence provides insights into the basis of the versatility and intrinsic drug resistance of p aeruginosa consistent with its larger genome size and environmental adaptability p aeruginosa contains the highest proportion of regulatory genes observed for a bacterial genome and a large number of genes involved in the catabolism transport and efflux of organic compounds as well as four potential chemotaxis systems we propose that the size and complexity of the p aeruginosa genome reflect an evolutionary adaptation permitting it to thrive in diverse environments and resist the effects of a variety of antimicrobial substances
B,protein products of the cyse region at 81 min on the chromosome of escherichia coli k-12 1 were analyzed by the maxicell method two kinds of polypeptides of molecular weight 33 k and 16 k were the products the open reading frame orf of the 33 k polypeptide consisted of 273 amino acids mr  29261 on the other hand the 16 k orf was overlapped by the opposite 33 k orf and specified an extremely basic protein of 130 amino acids mr  15233 the gene coding for the 16 k polypeptide was named cysx the expression of cyse and cysx in vivo was confirmed further by constructions of the cyse'-'lacz and cysx'-'lacz hybrid genes
E,the dna polymerase chain reaction was developed for in vitro amplification of specific dna sequences and it has been used for a wide variety of purposes in several fields we have developed an application of the polymerase chain reaction that is useful for the isolation of partial cdna or genomic clones of conserved genes we used this technique to clone the gene encoding the iron protein subunit 27 kda of succinate dehydrogenase ec 1351 from several species including human rat drosophila melanogaster arabidopsis thaliana schizosaccharomyces pombe and saccharomyces cerevisiae mixed oligonucleotide primers corresponding to two conserved regions of the protein were used in conjunction with genomic and cdna templates in the reaction the primers contained all possible nucleotide combinations that could encode the corresponding peptide sequences these oligonucleotide mixtures contained 262144 218 and 8192 213 unique sequences respectively use of the polymerase chain reaction for homology probing allows one to utilize more complex mixtures of oligonucleotides as probes than is possible with filter hybridization screening techniques in addition the polymerase chain reaction offers the advantage of synthesizing the dna product directly in some cases obviating the need to construct cdna or genomic libraries this application of the polymerase chain reaction should be useful not only for the identification of conserved genes in a variety of species but also for the isolation of previously unknown members of gene families
E,to assess evolutionary relationships among the oomycetous fungi we have constructed a physical and genic map of the mtdna of a broad host range strain 695t of phytophthora megasperma while like other phytophthora species this 435 kb circular genome lacks the typical oomycete large inverted repeat a short 05-09 kb inverted repeat has been identified comparison of the relative order of seven genic regions with host-specific phytophthora strains reveals both a clustering of these loci within one-third of the host-specific genomes and two genic inversions relative to the broad host range genome the location of the short inverted repeat suggests that at least one of the inversions is a consequence of intramolecular recombination between repeat elements
V,simian acquired immune deficiency syndrome saids in the macaque genus of monkeys at the california primate research center is apparently caused by infection by a type d retrovirus the complete nucleotide sequence 8173 base pairs of a molecular clone of the prototype saids virus isolate srv-1 reveals a typical retrovirus structure with long terminal repeats 346 base pairs and open reading frames for the gag 663 codons pol 867 codons and env 605 codons genes srv-1 also has a separate open reading frame of 314 codons between the gag and pol genes that defines the viral protease gene prt and a short open reading frame of unknown significance downstream from the env gene the srv-1 protease region shows a high degree of homology to its counterpart in the hamster intracisternal a-type particle genome both these protease genes are about twice as long as the analogous region of other retroviruses srv-1 has no notable similarity in either genetic organization or sequence to the human aids retroviruses
E,murine cd22 mcd22 is a b cell-associated adhesion protein with seven extracellular ig-like domains that has 62 amino acid identity to its human homologue southern analysis on genomic dna isolated from tissues and cell lines from several mouse strains using mcd22 cdna demonstrated that the cd22 locus encoding mcd22 is a single copy gene of 60 or  30 kb digestion of genomic dna preparations with four restriction endonucleases revealed the presence of restriction fragment length polymorphisms rflp in balbc c57bl6 and c3h strains vs dba2j nzb and nzc strains suggesting the presence of two or more cd22 alleles using a mcd22 cdna clone derived from the balbc strain we isolated genomic clones from a dba2j genomic library that contained all the exons necessary to encode the full length mcd22 cdna fifteen exons including exon 3 that encodes the translation start codon were identified each extracellular ig-like domain of mcd22 is encoded by a single exon a comparison between the nucleotide sequences of the balbc cd22 cdna and the exons of the dba2j cd22 genomic clones revealed an 18-nucleotide deletion in exon 4 encoding the most distal ig-like domain 1 of mcd22 of the dba2j genomic sequence in addition to a number of substitutions insertions and deletions in other exons these nucleotide differences were also present in a cdna clone isolated from total rna of lps-activated dba2j splenocytes by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction the cd22 locus was mapped to the proximal region of chromosome 7 a region sytenic to human chromosome 19q close to the previously reported loci lyb-8 and mag a homologue of cd22 an antibody cy34 against the lyb-82 b cell marker reacted with a bhk transfectant expressing the full length mcd22 cdna thus demonstrating that lyb-8 and cd22 loci are identical furthermore a rat anti-mcd22 mab nim-r6 bound to sigm dba2j b cells confirming the expression of a cd22 protein by the cd22alyb-8a allele
A,extremely halophilic archaea which flourish in hypersaline environments are known to contain a variety of large dynamic replicons previously the analysis of one such replicon pnrc100 in halobacterium sp strain nrc-1 showed that it undergoes high-frequency insertion sequence is element-mediated insertions and deletions as well as inversions via recombination between 39-kb-long inverted repeats irs now the complete sequencing of pnrc100 a 191346-bp circle has shown the presence of 27 is elements representing eight families a total of 176 orfs or likely genes of 850-bp average size were found 39 of which were repeated within the large irs more than one-half of the orfs are likely to represent novel genes that have no known homologs in the databases among orfs with previously characterized homologs three different copies of putative plasmid replication and four copies of partitioning genes were found suggesting that pnrc100 evolved from is element-mediated fusions of several smaller plasmids consistent with this idea putative genes typically found on plasmids including those encoding a restriction-modification system and arsenic resistance as well as buoyant gas-filled vesicles and a two-component regulatory system were found on pnrc100 however additional putative genes not expected on an extrachromosomal element such as those encoding an electron transport chain cytochrome d oxidase dna nucleotide synthesis enzymes thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase and eukaryotic-like tata-binding protein transcription factors and a chromosomal replication initiator protein were also found a multi-step is element-mediated process is proposed to account for the acquisition of these chromosomal genes the finding of essential genes on pnrc100 and its property of resistance to curing suggest that this replicon may be evolving into a new chromosome
E,we previously reported that a host cell glycoprotein gp180 binds duck hepatitis b virus particles and is encoded by a member of the carboxypeptidase gene family kuroki k eng f ishikawa t turck c harada f ganem d 1995 gp180 a host cell glycoprotein that binds duck hepatitis b virus particles is encoded by a member of the carboxypeptidase gene family j biol chem 270 15022-15028 after that report carboxypeptidase d cpd was subsequently purified from bovine pituitary and characterized as a novel carboxypeptidase e cpe-like enzyme with many characteristics in common with duck gp180 song l fricker ld 1995 purification and characterization of carboxypeptidase d a novel carboxypeptidase e-like enzyme from bovine pituitary j biol chem 270 25007-25013 cpd is now supposed to play an important role in a secretory pathway to clarify the function of gp180 further we have isolated and analyzed human and mouse homologues of duck gp180 cdna clones derived from human hepg2 cells and mouse livers have been isolated on the basis of homology to the duck gp180 the suggested open reading frames of the human and mouse cdna encode 1380 and 1377 amino acid proteins respectively and have three carboxypeptidase homologous domains a b and c domains a and b have completely conserved the residues known to have the enzymatic activity of carboxypeptidase but domain c in each cdna does not northern blotting revealed a ubiquitous tissue distribution of human gp180 mrna with several transcript species expression of human gp180 cdna in transfected 293t60hsp sp  0 25cells exhibited carboxypeptidase activity upon radiometric assay the human and mouse homologues of duck gp180 have many characteristics in common with bovine cpd fluorescence in-situ hybridization reveals that the gene encoding human gp180 is located in region 17q112
E,the primary structure of the gamma 1 subunit of human liver alcohol dehydrogenase isoenzyme gamma 1 gamma 1 was deduced by characterization of 36 tryptic and 2 cnbr peptides the polypeptide chain is composed of 373 amino acid residues gamma 1 differs from the beta 1 subunit of human liver alcohol dehydrogenase at 21 positions and from the e subunit of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase at 43 positions including a gap at position 128 as in the beta 1 subunit all zinc-liganding residues from the e subunit of the horse protein and the beta 1 subunit of the human enzyme are conserved but like beta 1 gamma 1 also has an additional cysteine residue at position 286 in the positional numbering system of the horse enzyme due to a tyr----cys exchange most amino acid exchanges preserve the properties of the residues affected and are largely located on the surface of the molecules away from the active site and the coenzyme binding region however eight positions with charge differences in relation to the e subunit of the horse enzyme are noticed these result in a net positive charge increase of one in gamma 1 versus e explaining the electrophoretic mobilities on starch gels of functional significance is the conservation of ser-48 in gamma 1 relative to e the residue is close to the active site but different thr-48 in the beta 1 subunit of the human enzyme thus the closer structural relationship between human gamma 1 and horse e enzyme subunit than between beta 1 and e is also reflected in functionally important residues explaining a greater similarity between gamma 1 gamma 1 and ee than between beta 1 beta 1 and ee
B,almost all aphid species homoptera insecta have 60-80 huge cells called bacteriocytes within which are round-shaped bacteria that are designated buchnera these bacteria are maternally transmitted to eggs and embryos through host generations and the mutualism between the host and the bacteria is so obligate that neither can reproduce independently buchnera is a close relative of escherichia coli but it contains more than 100 genomic copies per cell and its genome size is only a seventh of that of e coli here we report the complete genome sequence of buchnera sp strain aps which is composed of one 640681-base-pair chromosome and two small plasmids there are genes for the biosyntheses of amino acids essential for the hosts in the genome but those for non-essential amino acids are missing indicating complementarity and syntrophy between the host and the symbiont in addition buchnera lacks genes for the biosynthesis of cell-surface components including lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids regulator genes and genes involved in defence of the cell these results indicate that buchnera is completely symbiotic and viable only in its limited niche the bacteriocyte
E,17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 17hsds are enzymes catalyzing the conversion between 17 beta-hydroxy- and 17-ketosteroids both estrogens and androgens possess their highest activity in the 17 beta-hydroxy form and the enzymes therefore regulate the biological activity of sex hormones in this study we have characterized the complementary dna cdna for rat 17hsd type 2 the cdna encodes a protein with a predicted mol wt of 42010 da the protein has 77 similarity and 62 identity with the human 17hsd type 2 enzyme furthermore the hydropathicity profiles of the enzymes are very similar the two isozymes contain a putative transmembrane region close to the n-terminus however the rat isozyme lacks the two lysine-rich amino acid cluster present at the n- and c-terminals of human 17hsd type 2 the tissue distribution of the rat 17hsd type 1 and type 2 enzymes is very similar to that of the human enzymes the highest expression of 17hsd type 2 was detected in the placenta in addition a 15-kilobase messenger rna for the enzyme was detected in the small intestine liver and kidney of both sexes the two messenger rnas for rat 17hsd type 1 14 and 17 kilobases were highly expressed only in the ovary and at very low concentrations in the kidney of both sexes transiently expressed rat 17hsd type 2 showed oxidative activity almost exclusively in cultured human embryonic kidney 293 cells converting estradiol into estrone and testosterone into androstenedione whereas the opposite was observed for the rat type 1 enzyme the data suggest that similarly to the corresponding human isoforms rat 17hsd type 2 is mostly involved in the oxidation of 17 beta-hydroxysteroids into their relatively inactive keto derivative in peripheral tissues whereas rat 17hsd type 1 is mainly involved in the glandular biosynthesis of estradiol
E,farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase fps ec 25110 produces the 15-carbon farnesyl pyrophosphate which is utilized in the synthesis of sterols carotenoids dolichols coenzyme q heme a and farnesylated proteins we have cloned this mrna sequence from a maize endosperm cdna library and determined the 1378-nucleotide nt sequence of the dna fragment this sequence specifies an open reading frame of 1050 nt encoding fps the deduced amino acid sequence shows a high degree of similarity to fps from a wide range of organisms southern blot analysis indicated that there are at least two fps gene copies in the maize genome the cloned fps is expressed preferentially in maize endosperm and is up-regulated in the endosperm mutants o2 and fl2
E,four isoforms of the catalytic alpha subunit of the nak-atpase have been previously identified we characterized and mapped a genomic copy of the human atp1a4 isoform between d1s2707 and wi-9524 telomeric to a nearby isoform atp1a2 and within a candidate region at 1q23 for familial hemiplegic migraine fhm human atp1a4 gene shares 84 identity with the mouse atp1a4 gene and both consist of 22 exons and 21 introns the predicted polypeptide is 1029 amino acids and shares 82 and 798 identity respectively with human atp1a2 and atp1a1 atp1a4 is larger than other isoforms and most divergent at the n-terminus atp1a4 and atp1a2 are paralogous genes with the same number and organization of putative h-transmembrane domains conserved exon-intron boundaries and are found approximately 85 kb apart expression analysis of the atp1a4 gene revealed a new major approximately 75 kb transcript in human skeletal muscle with expression also shown in mouse muscle predictive analysis of promoter regions identified muscle specific regulatory elements for atp1a4 and atp1a4 mutation analysis among eight affected individuals from a single large highly penetrant fhm family was negative in atp1a4 and atp1a2 although multiple polymorphisms were identified
E,fibroblast growth factors fgfs and their receptors play an important role in cell growth angiogenesis and embryonal development four distinct genes encoding fibroblast growth factor receptors fgfrs were identified flg encoding fgfr1 bek encoding fgfr2 and the genes for fgfr3 and fgfr4 both fgfr2 and keratinocyte growth factor receptor kgfr are encoded by the same gene bek to study the regulation of expression of the fgf receptors we analysed the dna sequence flanking the 5' region of the cdna of murine fgfr2 to seek elements that control its transcription a 5-kbp fragment containing the 5' end of the cdna was isolated from mouse genomic library and used to map the promoter region we found that the sequence encoding the 5' non-translated region of the fgfr2kgfr cdna contains an intron located 210 bp upstream from the translation start site using rnaase protection and primer extension we identified the mrna start 37 bp upstream from the beginning of the bek cdna the promoter activity was found to reside in a 13-kbp fragment upstream from the cdna and deletion mapping further localized the promoter to a 07-kbp fragment the sequence of this region shows high gc content 62 which is particularly emphasized in the 200 bp upstream from the mrna start 80 gc this region contains the ccgccc gggcgg and ggagg motifs also found in promoters of other growth factor receptors neither tata nor caat boxes were found near the rna start site the characterization of this promoter will allow studies of the regulation of expression of the fgfr2 during development and in pathophysiological states the differences between the promoter sequence of the gene for fgfr2 bek and fgfr1 flg may explain their differential expression during development
B,we have constructed a library of clostridium pasteurianum dna cloned in the plasmid pbr322 based on the known amino acid sequence for c pasteurianum ferredoxin a 64-fold degenerate heptadecanucleotide pool was synthesized this mixed probe hybridized to two clones which were shown to contain greater than 6 kilobase pairs of the same genomic dna sequence analysis of a common sau3a1 06-kilobase-pair fragment revealed that it contains the information for the apoferredoxin structural gene according to the dna sequence the only post-translational processing of this small apoprotein is the hydrolysis of the initiator methionine putative transcription and translation start and stop signals are present within the sequence
E,trypanosoma brucei variant surface glycoprotein vsg genes are activated either by duplicative da transposition of the gene to a pre-activated expression site or by nonduplicative nda activation of a previously silent telomeric gene we have obtained a recombinant clone spanning the 5' barren region of the expression linked copy of the duplicated vsg gene 117a by dna sequence and hybridization analyses we have identified a pleomorphic family of 14-25 non-vsg genes that lie upstream of both da and nda vsg expression sites these expression site associated genes esags encode 12 kb polya mrnas that are specifically transcribed from the active vsg expression telomere in mammalian bloodstream stages of t brucei but in common with vsg genes are not transcribed in procyclic culture forms cdna and genomic sequences predict open reading frames that are conserved in the two esags examined
B,countless millions of people have died from tuberculosis a chronic infectious disease caused by the tubercle bacillus the complete genome sequence of the best-characterized strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv has been determined and analysed in order to improve our understanding of the biology of this slow-growing pathogen and to help the conception of new prophylactic and therapeutic interventions the genome comprises 4411529 base pairs contains around 4000 genes and has a very high guanine  cytosine content that is reflected in the blased amino-acid content of the proteins m tuberculosis differs radically from other bacteria in that a very large portion of its coding capacity is devoted to the production of enzymes involved in lipogenesis and lipolysis and to two new families of glycine-rich proteins with a repetitive structure that may represent a source of antigenic variation
B,a dna fragment that can functionally substitute for cfad the positive regulatory gene involved in expression of cfai fimbriae has recently been cloned from an escherichia coli strain of serotype o167h5 that produces cs5 fimbriae nucleotide sequence determination showed that the fragment contained a gene csvr coli surface virulence factor regulator homologous to the cfad gene which encoded for a protein of 301 amino acid residues the csvr gene was found to be located between two different insertion sequences comparison of the amino acid sequence of the csvr and cfad proteins showed that csvr is 34 amino acid residues longer at the c-terminus and in the sequence it also contains an insertion of two amino acid residues the similarity between cfad and rns the positive regulator of cs1 and cs2 expression is much higher 97 than between csvr and cfad 87 this is reflected by the fact that the level of expression of cfai fimbriae induced by csvr is not as high as when expression is induced by cfad or rns
B,metabolites such as diaminopimelate and some aromatic derivatives not synthesized in mammalian cells are essential for growth of bacteria as a first step towards the design of a new human live vaccine that uses attenuated strains of leptospira interrogans the asd arod and dapd genes encoding aspartate beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase 3-dehydroquinase and tetrahydrodipicolinate n-succinyltransferase respectively were cloned by complementation of escherichia coli mutants the complete nucleotide sequence of the asd gene was determined and found to contain an open reading frame capable of encoding a protein of 349 amino acids with a calculated mr of 38007 comparison of this deduced l interrogans aspartate beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase amino acid sequence with those of the same enzyme from saccharomyces cerevisiae and corynebacterium glutamicum revealed 46 and 36 identity respectively by contrast the identity between the l interrogans enzyme and the streptococcus mutans or e coli enzymes was less than 31 highly conserved sequences within aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase from the five organisms were observed at the amino and carboxyl termini and around the cysteine of the active site
E,down syndrome is the most common birth defect and is caused by trisomy 21 we identified a novel gene in the so-called down syndrome critical region by means of computer-aided exon prediction and subsequent cdna cloning the gene designated as dcra down syndrome critical region gene a consists of eight exons of 3252 bp in total and encodes a large open reading frame of 297 amino acid residues the open reading frame shows significant homology to hbeta58 a mouse gene essential for embryogenesis pep8 a yeast homologue of hbeta58 and an expressed sequence tag of arabidopsis thariana suggesting that dcra has some important function that has been conserved during the course of evolution dcra is expressed in most tissues examined including fetal and adult brain heart lung liver and kidney the cdna of the dcra mouse homologue dcra was also cloned it is 2157 bp long and has an open reading frame of 297 amino acid residues which shows 92 identity to human dcra dcra is expressed in all the embryo and adult tissues examined
B,culture filtrates of streptomyces clavuligerus contain a proteinaceous beta-lactamase inhibitor blip in addition to a variety of beta-lactam compounds blip was first detected by its ability to inhibit bactopenase a penicillinase derived from bacillus cereus but it has also been shown to inhibit the plasmid puc- and chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases of escherichia coli blip showed no inhibitory effect against enterobacter cloacae beta-lactamase and it also showed no activity against an alternative source of b cereus penicillinase blip was purified to homogeneity and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave a size estimate for blip of 16900 to 18000 the interaction between purified blip and the e colipuc beta-lactamase was investigated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and determined to be noncovalent with an estimated 11 molar stoichiometry the blip gene was isolated on a 135-kilobase fragment of s clavuligerus chromosomal dna which did not overlap a 40-kilobase region of dna known to contain genes for beta-lactam antibiotic biosynthesis the gene encoded a mature protein with a deduced amino acid sequence of 165 residues calculated molecular weight of 17523 and also encoded a 36-amino-acid signal sequence no significant sequence similarity to blip was found by pairwise comparisons using various protein and nucleotide sequence data banks or by hybridization experiments and no blip activity was detected in the culture supernatants of other streptomyces spp
E,phylogenetic analysis of conservative nucleotide substitutions in 18 complete sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of phocidae true seals odobenidae walruses and otariidae sea lions and fur seals plus three ursid and three felid sequences identified the pinnipeds as monophyletic with otariidae and odobenidae on a common evolutionary branch analysis of total nucleotide differences separated the evolutionary lineages of northern and southern phocids both lineages are distinct from the most ancestral phocid genus monachus monk seals represented by the hawaiian monk seal the inclusion of the hawaiian monk seal in the subfamily monachinae makes the subfamily paraphyletic among the northern phocids the hooded seal genus cystophora chromosome number 2n  34 is sister taxon to the phoca complex the phoca complex which is characterized by the chromosome number 2n  32 includes genus phoca and the monotypic genus halichoerus grey seal the comparison does not support a generic distinction of halichoerus within the phoca complex the present data suggest that cystophora and phoca separated  or  6 million years ago among the southern phocids the close molecular relationship of the weddell and leopard seals relative to their morphological distinction exemplifies rapid adaptation to different ecological niches this result stands in contrast to the limited morphological differentiation relative to the pronounced molecular distinctions that may occur within the phoca complex
B,background vibrio parahaemolyticus a gram-negative marine bacterium is a worldwide cause of food-borne gastroenteritis v parahaemolyticus strains of a few specific serotypes probably derived from a common clonal ancestor have lately caused a pandemic of gastroenteritis the organism is phylogenetically close to v cholerae the causative agent of cholera methods the whole genome sequence of a clinical v parahaemolyticus strain rimd2210633 was established by shotgun sequencing the coding sequences were identified by use of gambler and glimmer programs comparative analysis with the v cholerae genome was undertaken with mummer findings the genome consisted of two circular chromosomes of 3288558 bp and 1877212 bp it contained 4832 genes comparison of the v parahaemolyticus genome with that of v cholerae showed many rearrangements within and between the two chromosomes genes for the type iii secretion system ttss were identified in the genome of v parahaemolyticus v cholerae does not have these genes interpretation the ttss is a central virulence factor of diarrhoea-causing bacteria such as shigella salmonella and enteropathogenic escherichia coli which cause gastroenteritis by invading or intimately interacting with intestinal epithelial cells our results suggest that v parahaemolyticus and v cholerae use distinct mechanisms to establish infection this finding explains clinical features of v parahaemolyticus infections which commonly include inflammatory diarrhoea and in some cases systemic manifestations such as septicaemia distinct from those of v cholerae infections which are generally associated with non-inflammatory diarrhoea
E,down syndrome ds a major cause of mental retardation is characterized by subtle abnormalities of cortical neuroanatomy neurochemistry and function recent work has shown that chromosome band 21q22 is critical for many of the neurological phenotypes of ds a gene dscam down syndrome cell adhesion molecule has now been isolated from chromosome band 21q222-223 homology searches indicate that the putative dscam protein is a novel member of the immunoglobulin ig superfamily that represents a new class of neural cell adhesion molecules the sequence of cdnas indicates alternative splicing and predicts two protein isoforms both containing 10 ig-c2 domains with nine at the n-terminus and the tenth located between domains 4 and 5 of the following array of six fibronectin iii domains with or without the following transmembrane and intracellular domains northern analyses reveals the transcripts of 97 85 and 76 kb primarily in brain these transcripts are differentially expressed in substructures of the adult brain tissue in situ hybridization analyses of a mouse homolog of the dscam gene revealed broad expression within the nervous system at the time of neuronal differentiation in the neural tube cortex hippocampus medulla spinal cord and most neural crest-derived tissues given its location on chromosome 21 its specific expression in the central nervous system and neural crest and the homologies to molecules involved in neural migration differentiation and synaptic function we propose that dscam is involved in neural differentiation and contributes to the central and peripheral nervous system defects in ds
V,woodchuck hepatitis virus whv dna was cloned from viral particles obtained from the serum of a woodchuck with a naturally acquired infection the complete nucleotide sequence of the virus genome was determined and found to be 3323 base pairs long transfection experiments demonstrated that the recombinant whv dna was infectious in each of 18 woodchucks tested and established a chronic carrier state in 1 of 13 neonates and 3 of 5 adult animals whv dna from serum particles from the chronically infected neonate was cloned and the nucleotide sequence of three independent recombinants was compared directly with that of the input recombinant dna the consensus sequence of the three progeny genomes was identical to that of the parental dna sequence therefore transfection of woodchuck livers with recombinant whv dna induces active virus replication and gene expression and yields progeny genomes that are faithful copies of the input virus genome
A,the complete genomic sequence of the archaeon thermoplasma volcanium possessing optimum growth temperature ogt of 60 degrees c is reported by systematically comparing this genomic sequence with the other known genomic sequences of archaea all possessing higher ogt a number of strong correlations have been identified between characteristics of genomic organization and the ogt with increasing ogt in the genomic dna frequency of clustering purines and pyrimidines into separate dinucleotides rises eg by often forming aa and tt whereas avoiding ta and at proteins coded in a genome are divided into two distinct subpopulations possessing isoelectric points in different ranges ie acidic and basic and with increasing ogt the size of the basic subpopulation becomes larger at the metabolic level genes coding for enzymes mediating pathways for synthesizing some coenzymes such as heme start missing these findings provide insights into the design of individual genomic components as well as principles for coordinating changes in these designs for the adaptation to new environments
E,the schizosaccharomyces pombe gene fkp39 encoding a homolog of fkbpfk506 binding protein-type peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase ppiase was isolated and the primary structure was determined this gene product spfkbp39p showed ppiase enzymatic activity in a chymotrypsin-dependent enzyme assay involving recombinant spfkbp39p comparison of the primary structures of the catalytic domains of fkbps including spfkbp39p revealed that fkbps could be classified into four groups this categorization corresponding to the known subcellular localization of the fkbps makes the prediction of the subcellular localization of fkbps based on their primary structures feasible spfkbp39p was considered to be a member of the nuclear-type fkbp group from this relationship between primary structure and subcellular localization an immunofluorescence assay against ha-epitope-tagged spfkbp39p revealed that spfkbp39p is localized to the nucleus as predicted residues conserved in a group-specific manner in the catalytic domain were mapped to their corresponding three-dimensional positions these group-specific residues were located in close proximity in distinct regions mostly on the protein surface which implies the presence of group-specific regulatory functional regions we also found that nuclear-type fkbps including spfkbp39p have two highly conserved domains other than catalytic ones with further basic and acidic charged regions especially in the case of nuclear-type fkbps this is the first report indicating that there is a rule for the relationship between the subcellular localization and structure of the catalytic domain of a fkbp
B,enteroaggregative escherichia coli eaggec has been associated with persistent pediatric diarrhea in the developing world yet the pathogenetic mechanisms of eaggec infection are unknown our previous data have suggested that aggregative adherence of some eaggec strains to hep-2 cells is mediated by flexible bundle-forming fimbriae which we have termed aggregative adherence fimbriae i aafi genes sufficient to confer expression of aafi are located on the 60-mda plasmid of eaggec 17-2 aafi genes are present as two unlinked plasmid regions regions 1 and 2 separated by 9 kb of dna here we report the complete dna sequencing of region 2 and the identification of an open reading frame which is involved in the expression of aafi one open reading frame of 794 bp encodes a protein designated aggr with a predicted molecular size of 294 kda which shows a high degree of amino acid sequence identity to cfar and other members of the arac class of gene regulators the cloned aggr gene or alternatively a cloned cfar gene was sufficient to complement a region 1 clone to confer aafi expression to further substantiate the role of aggr in the regulation of aafi we constructed a 289-bp in-frame aggr deletion and replaced the native gene in 17-2 by allelic exchange using the temperature-sensitive vector pib307 the resulting aggr deletions were negative for aafi expression but expression was restored when the aggr gene cloned into pbluescript ii sk was reintroduced into the aggr mutant rna slot blot experiments using a probe for the putative aafi pilin subunit agga revealed that aggr operates as a transcriptional activator of agga expression aggaphoa fusions were constructed in 17-2 and in 17-2 delta aggr aggr was found to promote expression of the agga gene under a variety of conditions of temperature osmolarity oxygen tension and medium at acid ph agga expression was maximal and was regulated by both aggr-dependent and aggr-independent mechanisms
B,the amino acid sequence of the spirulina maxima ferredoxin was shown to be h2n-ala-thr-tyr-lys-val-thr-leu-ile-ser-glu-ala-glu-gly-ile-asn-glu-thr-ile-asp-cys-asp-asp-asp-thr-tyr-ile-leu-asp-ala-ala-glu-glu-ala-gly-leu-asp-leu-pro-tyr-ser-cys-arg-ala-gly-ala-cys-ser-thr-cys-ala-gly-lys-ile-thr-ser-gly-ser-ile-asp-gln-ser-asp-gln-ser-phe-leu-asp-asp-asp-gln-ile-gln-ala-gly-tyr-val-leu-thr-cys-val-ala-tyr-pro-thr-ser-asp-cys-thr-ile-gln-thr-his-gln-glu-glu-gly-leu-tyr-cooh the s maxima ferredoxin is the first procaryote ferredoxin of the plant-algal type to be reported a modification of the automated sequence determination of a peptide which was extracted by the organic solvents used to remove excess reagents and the amino acid thiazoline was utilized to complete the sequence of a 36 residue tryptic peptide
E,using a polymerase chain reaction-mediated cloning procedure we have identified a novel member termed ana from abundant in neuroepithelium area of tobbtg1 family of antiproliferative genes molecular cloning and analysis of cdnas revealed that the human and mouse ana encoded a protein of 252 amino acids the amino-terminal half of ana was homologous to the previously characterized antiproliferative gene products btg1 pc3tis21btg2 and tob the human ana gene was localized at chromosome 21q112-q211 ana was expressed in a variety of tissues and cell lines its expression being high in the ovary testis prostate thymus and lung further analysis revealed that ana expression was high in the ventricular zone of the developing central nervous system finally overexpression of ana impaired serum-induced cell cycle progression from the g0g1 to s phase in conclusion ana is a fourth member of the tobbtg1 family that might play roles in neurogenesis in the central nervous system
B,the 331-mb genome sequence of the intracellular pathogen and potential bioterrorism agent brucella suis was determined comparison of b suis with brucella melitensis has defined a finite set of differences that could be responsible for the differences in virulence and host preference between these organisms and indicates that phage have played a significant role in their divergence analysis of the b suis genome reveals transport and metabolic capabilities akin to soilplant-associated bacteria extensive gene synteny between b suis chromosome 1 and the genome of the plant symbiont mesorhizobium loti emphasizes the similarity between this animal pathogen and plant pathogens and symbionts a limited repertoire of genes homologous to known bacterial virulence factors were identified
E,using the yeast two-hybrid protein-protein interaction system to search for genes capable of forming dimers with the antiapoptotic protein mcl-1 we have isolated bod bcl-2-related ovarian death agonist from an ovarian fusion cdna library the three variants of bod long medium and short have an open reading frame of 196 110 and 93 amino acids respectively all of them contain a consensus bcl-2 homology 3 bh3 domain but lack other bh domains found in channel-forming bcl-2 family proteins in the yeast cell assay bod interacts with diverse antiapoptotic bcl-2 proteins mcl-1 bcl-2 bcl-xl bcl-w bfl-1 and epstein-barr virus ebv bhrf-1 but not with different proapoptotic bcl-2 proteins bad bak bok and bax after overexpression in mammalian chinese hamster ovary cho cells bod induces apoptosis that can be prevented by the baculoviral caspase inhibitor p35 the cell-killing activity of bod is also antagonized in cells cotransfected with the antiapoptotic bcl-w protein which showed high affinity for bod in the two-hybrid assay furthermore mutagenesis studies showed that bod mutants with alterations in the bh3 domain lose cell-killing ability suggesting that the bh3 domain is important for the mediation of cell killing by bod bod mrna is ubiquitously expressed in ovary and multiple other tissues the bod gene is also conserved in diverse mammalian species identification of bod expands the group of proapoptotic bcl-2 proteins that only contains the bh3 domain and allows future elucidation of the intracellular mechanism for apoptosis regulation in ovary and other tissues
B,the fdsgbacd operon encoding the four subunits of the nad-reducing formate dehydrogenase of ralstonia eutropha h16 was cloned and sequenced sequence comparisons indicated a high resemblance of fdsa alpha-subunit to the catalytic subunits of formate dehydrogenases containing a molybdenum or tungsten cofactor the nh2-terminal region residues 1-240 of fdsa lacking in formate dehydrogenases not linked to nadp exhibited considerable similarity to that of nuog of the nadhubiquinone oxidoreductase from escherichia coli as well as to hoxu and the nh2-terminal segment of hndd of nadp-reducing hydrogenases fdsb beta-subunit and fdsg gamma-subunit are closely related to nuof and nuoe respectively as well as to hoxf and hnda it is proposed that the nh2-terminal domain of fdsa together with fdsb and fdsg constitute a functional entity corresponding to the nadh dehydrogenase diaphorase part of nadhubiquinone oxidoreductase and the hydrogenases no significant similarity to any known protein was observed for fdsd delta-subunit the predicted product of fdsc showed the highest resemblance to fdhd from e coli a protein required for the formation of active formate dehydrogenases in this organism transcription of the fds operon is subject to formate induction a promoter structure resembling the consensus sequence of sigma70-dependent promoters from e coli was identified upstream of the transcriptional start site determined by primer extension analysis
E,a comparative study of the natriuretic-peptide receptor npr-b was performed by cloning and expressing in cos-1 cells the npr-b receptor subtype from the eel gill which exhibited a strong c-type-natriuretic-peptide cnp-induced guanylate cyclase activity like other mammalian npr-b receptors the eel npr-b receptor consisted of a ligand-binding extracellular domain a hydrophobic transmembrane domain a kinase-like domain and a guanylate cyclase domain sequence comparison among the eel and mammalian receptors revealed a relatively low similarity approximately 44 in the extracellular domain compared to a very high similarity approximately 84 in the cytoplasmic regulatory and catalytic domains this low similarity allowed identification of the amino acid residues or candidate regions important for the ligand-binding activity rnase protection analysis of the eel npr-b mrna demonstrated that the message was predominantly expressed in the liver and atrium as well as in the gill with moderate-to-small amounts in the brain ventricle esophageal sphincter stomach posterior intestine and kidney the high npr-b mrna levels in the liver atrium and gill were found to decrease markedly when eels were transferred from fresh water to seawater and kept there for 2 weeks since similar changes are known to occur in the ligand cnp levels when eels are facing osmotic challenges the cnpnpr-b system appears to play an important role in their successful adaptation to salinity changes
E,skeletal muscle development involves the formation of multi-nucleated myotubes this is thought to proceed by the induction of differentiation acquisition of fusion competence of myoblast cells their aggregation and union of their plasma membranes various membrane proteins including n- and m-cadherins n- and v-cams and integrins participate in myotube formation but the molecular mechanisms of muscle cell fusion are poorly understood here we report the identification of three new myoblast-expressed gene products meltrin-alpha beta and gamma with homology to both viper haemorrhagic factors and fertilin ph-30 a membrane protein involved in egg-sperm fusion meltrin-alpha a member of the metalloproteinasedisintegrin protein family appears to be required for myotube formation involvement of a fertilin-related protein in myogenesis suggests that there are common mechanisms in gamete and myoblast fusion
B,the genus xanthomonas is a diverse and economically important group of bacterial phytopathogens belonging to the gamma-subdivision of the proteobacteria xanthomonas axonopodis pv citri xac causes citrus canker which affects most commercial citrus cultivars resulting in significant losses worldwide symptoms include canker lesions leading to abscission of fruit and leaves and general tree decline xanthomonas campestris pv campestris xcc causes black rot which affects crucifers such as brassica and arabidopsis symptoms include marginal leaf chlorosis and darkening of vascular tissue accompanied by extensive wilting and necrosis xanthomonas campestris pv campestris is grown commercially to produce the exopolysaccharide xanthan gum which is used as a viscosifying and stabilizing agent in many industries here we report and compare the complete genome sequences of xac and xcc their distinct disease phenotypes and host ranges belie a high degree of similarity at the genomic level more than 80 of genes are shared and gene order is conserved along most of their respective chromosomes we identified several groups of strain-specific genes and on the basis of these groups we propose mechanisms that may explain the differing host specificities and pathogenic processes
E,perinatal development of cytochrome-c oxidase complex iv and ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase complex iii was investigated in rat heart and liver by analysing catalytic properties protein amounts and subunit isoforms during the transition from the fetal to the adult state the total amounts of complexes from milligram quantities of tissue and the portions of isoforms of complex iv were quantified densitometrically after isolation of the native complexes by blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and separation of the protein subunits by tricinesdspage schgger h 38 von jagow g 1991 anal biochem 199 223-231 a parallel increase of protein amounts and catalytic activities during perinatal development was observed in heart and liver for complex iii but only in liver for complex iv in heart both a doubling of the turnover number of complex iv and a lowered km for cytochrome c were observed the altered enzymic properties correlated with the increase of heart type subunits via and viii the fetal enzymes from heart and liver seem to be identical to the adult liver isoform as deduced from their enzymic properties and identical aminoterminal sequences of subunits via and viii
E,four avian beta-defension prepropeptide cdna sequences gallinacins gal 1 synonym chp 1 chicken heterophil peptide 1 and gal 2 turkey heterophil peptides thp 1 and thp 2 were amplified from chicken or turkey bone marrow mrna samples respectively partial chicken beta-defensin cdna sequences were obtained using degenerate primers based on chicken peptide sequences gal 1chp 1 and gal 2 the complete cdna sequences of the chicken beta-defensins were then determined by designing specific intrapeptidal primers from the newly acquired sequence and pairing one primer with a specific poly a primer tail sequence 3' end and the other primer with an adapter primer in a 5' rapid amplification of cdna ends race reaction the two turkey beta-defensins were amplified from turkey marrow using primers designed from chicken beta-defensin preproregions the complete amino acid sequences for the prepropeptides were deduced for all four avian beta-defensins previously only partial mature peptide sequences for the turkey beta-defensins and complete mature peptide sequences for the chicken beta-defensins were known all sequences obtained translated accurately to complete and partial amino acid sequences reported for beta-defensins purified from chicken and turkey heterophil granules except for one additional amino acid for gal 1chp 1 the four deduced beta-defensin proregions lack the long negatively charged propiece reported in classical defensin proregions these regions are thought to stabilize and inactivate the positively charged mature peptide and target the propeptide to the storage granule instead these beta-defensin proregions are shorter and similar to storage granule-free beta-defensins proregions reported for bovine tracheal antimicrobial peptide tap and lingual antimicrobial peptide lap these are the first prepropeptide beta-defensins from leukocyte granules to be completely characterized
E,ca2 atpases deplete the cytosol of ca2 ions and are crucial to cellular ca2 homeostasis the pmc1 gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a vacuole membrane protein that is 40 identical to the plasma membrane ca2 atpases pmcas of mammalian cells mutants lacking pmc1 grow well in standard media but sequester ca2 into the vacuole at 20 of the wild-type levels pmc1 null mutants fail to grow in media containing high levels of ca2 suggesting a role of pmc1 in ca2 tolerance the growth inhibitory effect of added ca2 requires activation of calcineurin a ca2 and calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase mutations in calcineurin a or b subunits or the inhibitory compounds fk506 and cyclosporin a restore growth of pmc1 mutants in high ca2 media also growth is restored by recessive mutations that inactivate the high-affinity ca2-binding sites in calmodulin this mutant calmodulin has apparently lost the ability to activate calcineurin in vivo these results suggest that activation of calcineurin by ca2 and calmodulin can negatively affect yeast growth a second ca2 atpase homolog encoded by the pmr1 gene acts together with pmc1 to prevent lethal activation of calcineurin even in standard low ca2 conditions we propose that these ca2 atpase homologs are essential in yeast to deplete the cytosol of ca2 ions which at elevated concentrations inhibits yeast growth through inappropriate activation of calcineurin
E,the riken mouse gene encyclopaedia project a systematic approach to determining the full coding potential of the mouse genome involves collection and sequencing of full-length complementary dnas and physical mapping of the corresponding genes to the mouse genome we organized an international functional annotation meeting fantom to annotate the first 21076 cdnas to be analysed in this project here we describe the first riken clone collection which is one of the largest described for any organism analysis of these cdnas extends known gene families and identifies new ones
B,the pseudomonas aeruginosa faba and fabb genes encoding beta-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein dehydratase and beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase i respectively were cloned sequenced and expressed in escherichia coli northern analysis demonstrated that faba and fabb are cotranscribed and most probably form a fabab operon the faba and fabb proteins were similar in size and amino acid composition to their counterparts from escherichia coli and to the putative homologs from haemophilus influenzae chromosomal faba and fabb mutants were isolated the mutants were auxotrophic for unsaturated fatty acids a temperature-sensitive faba mutant was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of a single base that induced a g101d change this mutant grew normally at 30 degrees c but not at 42 degrees c unless the growth medium was supplemented with oleate by physical and genetic mapping the fabab genes were localized between 345 and 36 mbp on the 59-mbp chromosome which corresponds to the 58- to 595-min region of the genetic map
E,we have cloned and sequenced 28 kilobases of cdna encoding the mouse androgen receptor by rna amplification with transcript sequencing sequence analysis predicts that this cdna contains an open reading frame of 2697 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of 899 amino acids androgen receptor cdna probes of dog guinea pig and frog were also isolated and sequenced using consensus primers derived from human and rat androgen receptor cdnas northern blot analysis with the species-specific probes revealed similarities in size between amphibian and mammalian mrnas these results demonstrate the utility of this technique in obtaining nucleic acid probes and sequence information of steroid receptors from different species the sequence data and the northern blot analysis of the receptors in different species demonstrate that the androgen receptor has been well-conserved during evolution
B,in planta expression of a high-affinity iron-uptake system involving the siderophore chrysobactin in erwinia chrysanthemi 3937 contributes greatly to invasive growth of this pathogen on its natural host african violets a previous study reported that global regulation by iron in this strain was mediated at the transcriptional level via the cbr locus which when inactivated by insertional mutation prevents the chrysobactin system from being tightly repressed by fecl3 herein we report the nucleotide sequence of this locus and the functional analysis of its encoded products sequence analysis of a 48 kb genomic segment of a plasmid encompassing the cbr locus and characterization of the cognate translated products made it possible to uncover a system exhibiting similarity with prokaryotic transporters implicated in the transport of iron complexes accordingly the cbra product was shown to be the periplasmic component of a permease complex also including two integral membrane proteins cbrb and cbrc and the atp-binding unit cbrd this system allowed internalization of feiii when supplied to bacterial cells as 59fecl3 or 59fe dicitrate via complexation to a second siderophore recently detected in strain 3937 most notably we demonstrate that this second siderophore-mediated iron-acquisition system is operational in bacterial cells grown in the presence of fecl3 the regulatory effect of cbr was further assessed on a lacz chrysobactin operon fusion indicating that the transcriptional control exerted by cbr on expression of the chrysobactin system is of homeostatic nature in conclusion e chrysanthemi provides an interesting model in which iron acquisition involves an inductive process resulting in differential expression of two siderophore-mediated pathways in relation to external iron accessibility
A,the complete sequence of the genome of an aerobic hyper-thermophilic crenarchaeon aeropyrum pernix k1 which optimally grows at 95 degrees c has been determined by the whole genome shotgun method with some modifications the entire length of the genome was 1669695 bp the authenticity of the entire sequence was supported by restriction analysis of long pcr products which were directly amplified from the genomic dna as the potential protein-coding regions a total of 2694 open reading frames orfs were assigned by similarity search against public databases 633 235 of the orfs were related to genes with putative function and 523 194 to the sequences registered but with unknown function all the genes in the tca cycle except for that of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase were included and instead of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase gene the genes coding for the two subunits of 2-oxoacidferredoxin oxidoreductase were identified the remaining 1538 orfs 571 did not show any significant similarity to the sequences in the databases sequence comparison among the assigned orfs suggested that a considerable member of orfs were generated by sequence duplication the rna genes identified were a single 16s-23s rrna operon two 5s rrna genes and 47 trna genes including 14 genes with intron structures all the assigned orfs and rna coding regions occupied 8912 of the whole genome the data presented in this paper are available on the internet homepage httpwwwmildnitegojp
B,the formate dehydrogenase of wolinella succinogenes is a membraneous molybdo-enzyme which is involved in phosphorylative electron transport the gene fdha encoding the largest subunit was isolated from a gene bank by immunological screening the fdha gene was located in an apparent transcriptional unit fdhabcd together with three more structural genes the n-terminal sequences of three polypeptides present in the isolated enzyme were found to map within the fdha b and c structural genes a polypeptide corresponding to fdhd was not detected in the enzyme preparation this suggested that the functional formate dehydrogenase was made up of three or four different subunits the genes fdha and c encode larger preproteins which differ from the corresponding mature proteins by n-terminal signal peptides the n-terminal half of the mature fdha is homologous to the larger subunits of the formate dehydrogenases of e coli formate-hydrogenlyase linked and methanobacterium formicicum as well as to three bacterial reductases containing molybdenum it harbours a conserved cysteine cluster and two more domains which may be involved in binding the molybdenum cofactor fdhb may represent an iron-sulphur protein twelve cysteine residues of which are arranged in two clusters which are typical of ligands of the iron-sulfur centers in ferredoxins fdhc is a hydrophobic protein with four predicted transmembrane segments which appears to be identical with the cytochrome b present in the isolated formate dehydrogenase it may form the membrane anchor of the enzyme and react with the bacterial menaquinone
E,we describe the isolation of a 3276 base pair cdna for the bovine natriuretic peptide receptor-b npr-b expression of this clone in cos-p cells demonstrates that it encodes an agonist-dependent guanylyl cyclase porcine cnp stimulates the activity of this receptor up to 200-fold with an ed50 of 12 - 2 nm whereas brain natriuretic peptide c-type natriuretic peptide cnp and atrial natriuretic factor anf are less efficacious in addition ligand binding studies indicate that this receptor exhibits the pharmacology appropriate for the bovine npr-b cnp binds to cos-p cell membranes expressing this clone with a kd of 13 - 1 pm and natriuretic peptides compete for 125i-cnp binding with a rank order of pcnp  pbnp  ranf thus the expressed receptor-guanylyl cyclase exhibits the expected pharmacological profile for ligand binding and cyclase activation of the bovine npr-b receptor
E,a cdna encoding the catalytic core of a novel brain 6-phosphofructo-2-kinasefructose-26-bisphosphatase isoenzyme was isolated from a lambda gt10 bovine brain library this brain cdna begins and ends in an open reading frame encoding a peptide of 476 amino acids this peptide contains both the catalytic kinase and bisphosphatase domains and has an overall 65 and 67 indentity with the bovine heart and liver isozymes respectively whereas the nh2 and cooh-termini are divergent an active catalytic core brain bifunctional enzyme was expressed in e coli using a t7 rna polymerase-based expression system these results support the presence of a distinct gene coding for the protein in bovine brain
B,we previously reported that an acidomycin-resistant mutant of serratia marcescens sr41 sb304 and a mutant that was derived from sb304 and was resistant to a higher concentration of acidomycin sb412 produced 5 and 20 mg of d-biotin respectively per liter of a medium containing sucrose and urea n sakurai y imai m masuda s komatsubara and t tosa appl environ microbiol 592857-2863 1993 in order to increase the productivity of d-biotin the biotin bio operons were cloned from strains sb412 sb304 and 8000 wild-type strain and plgm412 plgm304 and plgw101 respectively were obtained through subcloning these plasmids harbored 72-kb dna fragments coding for the bioabfcd genes on a low-copy-number vector and were introduced into sb304 sb412 and 8000 among the resulting recombinant strains sb412plgm304 exhibited the highest d-biotin production 200 mgliter in the production medium the plasmid was stably maintained in cells unexpectedly sb412plgm412 grew very slowly and the d-biotin productivity of this recombinant strain was not evaluated because plgm412 was unstable
B,the genome sequences of chlamydia trachomatis mouse pneumonitis mopn strain nigg 1 069 412 nt and chlamydia pneumoniae strain ar39 1 229 853 nt were determined using a random shotgun strategy the mopn genome exhibited a general conservation of gene order and content with the previously sequenced ctrachomatis serovar d differences between ctrachomatis strains were focused on an approximately 50 kb 'plasticity zone' near the termination origins in this region mopn contained three copies of a novel gene encoding a 3000 amino acid toxin homologous to a predicted toxin from escherichia coli o157h7 but had apparently lost the tryptophan biosyntheis genes found in serovar d in this region the c pneumoniae ar39 chromosome was 999 identical to the previously sequenced cpneumoniae cwl029 genome however comparative analysis identified an invertible dna segment upstream of the uridine kinase gene which was in different orientations in the two genomes ar39 also contained a novel 4524 nt circular single-stranded ssdna bacteriophage the first time a virus has been reported infecting c pneumoniae although the chlamydial genomes were highly conserved there were intriguing differences in key nucleotide salvage pathways cpneumoniae has a uridine kinase gene for dutp production mopn has a uracil phosphororibosyl transferase while ctrachomatis serovar d contains neither gene chromosomal comparison revealed that there had been multiple large inversion events since the species divergence of ctrachomatis and cpneumoniae apparently oriented around the axis of the origin of replication and the termination region the striking synteny of the chlamydia genomes and prevalence of tandemly duplicated genes are evidence of minimal chromosome rearrangement and foreign gene uptake presumably owing to the ecological isolation of the obligate intracellular parasites in the absence of genetic analysis comparative genomics will continue to provide insight into the virulence mechanisms of these important human pathogens
E,a p element pe-induced drosophila melanogaster mutation hari affects the formation of the bristle mechanosensory organ in the adult fly in this mutation the site of pe insertion is in the first intron of the gene cyca encoding cyclin a cyca in order to analyze the hari mutant at the molecular level we cloned and sequenced the cdna and genomic dna encoding cyca cyca has seven exons and six introns and its transcription unit spans 6 kb all exon-intron junctions are compatible with the gtag consensus results of primer extension analysis and rnase protection assay indicate that cyca has major and minor transcription start points tsp to our knowledge this is the first report on the cyca genomic sequence from a multicellular organism
V,the complete nucleotide sequence of the dna of indian cassava mosaic virus icmv and a key part of that of a group b isolate of african cassava mosaic virus from malawi acmv-m were determined and compared at the nucleotide and encoded amino acid levels with the published sequences of an acmv group a isolate acmv-k and other whitefly-transmitted gemini-viruses wtgs the dna of icmv consists of two circular single-stranded molecules dna-a 2815 nucleotides nt and dna-b 2645 nt which differ substantially in sequence from the genome components of acmv-k dna-a 70 dna-b 47 sequence identity and other wtgs icmv dna-a contains eight open reading frames orfs encoding proteins of  100 amino acid residues of which four orfs one genome sense three complementary sense are comparable to those of other wtgs dna-b contains one orf in each sense as in other wtgs none of the putative viral proteins are more similar in amino acid sequence to the proteins of acmv-k than to those of another wtg the coat protein of acmv-m is more like that of tomato yellow leaf curl virus from sardinia 86 sequence identity than those of icmv or acmv-k the intergenic regions of acmv-k acmv-m and icmv dnas differ in size and largely in sequence except for two 30 to 40 nt sequences which are also conserved in other wtgs and can form stem-loop structures the intergenic region of icmv dna contains three copies of a 41 nt sequence and that of acmv-m dna contains an imperfect repeat of a 34 nt sequence which resembles the repeated sequence in icmv dna the differences between acmv-k acmv-m and icmv are considered great enough to justify their separation as isolates of three distinct wtgs african cassava mosaic virus east african cassava mosaic virus and indian cassava mosaic virus
E,the bar mutation b of drosophila melanogaster and optic morphology mutation om1d of drosophila ananassae result in suppression of ommatidium differentiation at the anterior portion of the eye examinations was made to determine the genes responsible for these mutations both loci were found to share in common a different type of homeobox gene which we call barh1 polyptides encoded by d melanogaster and d ananassae barh1 genes consist of 543 and 604 amino acids respectively with homeodomains identical in sequence except for one amino acid substitution a unique feature of these homeodomains is that the phenylalanine residue in helix 3 conserved in all metazoan homeodomains so far examined is replaced by a tyrosine residue by northern blotting considerably more barh1 rna was detected in the bar mutant than in wild type p element-mediated transformation showed bar-like eye malformation to be induced by transient overexpression of the barh1 gene in the late third-instar larvae somatic recombination analysis indicated normal gene functions of the bar region including the barh1 gene to be required for normal eye morphogenesis
E,a nervous system-specific glycoprotein antigen from adult drosophila heads designated nervana nrv has been purified on the basis of reactivity of its carbohydrate epitopes with anti-horseradish peroxidase hrp antibodies that are specific markers for drosophila neurons anti-nrv monoclonal antibodies mabs specific for the protein moiety of nrv were used to screen a drosophila embryo cdna expression library three cdna clones designated nrv1 nrv21 and nrv22 were isolated that code for proteins recognized by anti-nrv mabs on western blots dna sequencing and southern blot analyses established that the cdna clones are derived from two different genes in situ hybridization to drosophila polytene chromosomes showed that the cdna clones map to the third chromosome near 92c-d nrv1 and nrv2122 have open reading frames of 309 and 322323 amino acids respectively and they are 434 identical at the amino acid level the proteins deduced from these clones exhibit significant homology in both primary sequence and predicted topology to the beta subunit of nak-atpase immunoaffinity-purified nrv is associated with a protein mr 100000 recognized on western blots by anti-atpase alpha-subunit mab our results suggest that the drosophila nervous system-specific antigens nrv1 and -2 are neuronal forms of the beta subunit of nak-atpase
E,recent studies have suggested the existence of a tumor suppressor gene located at chromosome region 5q21 dna probes from this region were used to study a panel of sporadic colorectal carcinomas one of these probes cosmid 571 detected a somatically rearranged restriction fragment in the dna from a single tumor further analysis of the 571 cosmid revealed two regions that were highly conserved in rodent dna these sequences were used to identify a gene mcc mutated in colorectal cancer which encodes an 829-amino acid protein with a short region of similarity to the g protein-coupled m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor the rearrangement in the tumor disrupted the coding region of the mcc gene moreover two colorectal tumors were found with somatically acquired point mutations in mcc that resulted in amino acid substitutions mcc is thus a candidate for the putative colorectal tumor suppressor gene located at 5q21 further studies will be required to determine whether the gene is mutated in other sporadic tumors or in the germ line of patients with an inherited predisposition to colonic tumorigenesis
E,two candida albicans genes that encode the protein synthesis factor elongation factor 1 alpha ef-1 alpha were cloned by using a heterologous tef1 probe from mucor racemosus to screen libraries of c albicans genomic dna sequence analysis of the two clones showed that regions of dna flanking the coding regions of the two genes were not homologous verifying the presence of two genes called tef1 and tef2 for ef-1 alpha in c albicans the coding regions of tef1 and tef2 differed by only five nucleotides and encoded identical ef-1 alpha proteins of 458 amino acids both genes were transcribed into mrna in vivo as shown by hybridization of oligonucleotide probes which bound specifically to the 3' nontranslated regions of tef1 and tef2 respectively to c albicans total rna in northern rna blot analysis the predicted ef-1 alpha protein of c albicans was more similar to saccharomyces cerevisiae ef-1 alpha than to m racemosus ef-1 alpha furthermore codon bias and the promoter and termination signals of the c albicans ef-1 alpha proteins were remarkably similar to those of s cerevisiae ef-1 alpha taken together these results suggest that c albicans is more closely related to the ascomycete s cerevisiae than to the zygomycete m racemosus
B,countless millions of people have died from tuberculosis a chronic infectious disease caused by the tubercle bacillus the complete genome sequence of the best-characterized strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv has been determined and analysed in order to improve our understanding of the biology of this slow-growing pathogen and to help the conception of new prophylactic and therapeutic interventions the genome comprises 4411529 base pairs contains around 4000 genes and has a very high guanine  cytosine content that is reflected in the blased amino-acid content of the proteins m tuberculosis differs radically from other bacteria in that a very large portion of its coding capacity is devoted to the production of enzymes involved in lipogenesis and lipolysis and to two new families of glycine-rich proteins with a repetitive structure that may represent a source of antigenic variation
E,we have sequenced and annotated the genome of fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe which contains the smallest number of protein-coding genes yet recorded for a eukaryote 4824 the centromeres are between 35 and 110 kilobases kb and contain related repeats including a highly conserved 18-kb element regions upstream of genes are longer than in budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae possibly reflecting more-extended control regions some 43 of the genes contain introns of which there are 4730 fifty genes have significant similarity with human disease genes half of these are cancer related we identify highly conserved genes important for eukaryotic cell organization including those required for the cytoskeleton compartmentation cell-cycle control proteolysis protein phosphorylation and rna splicing these genes may have originated with the appearance of eukaryotic life few similarly conserved genes that are important for multicellular organization were identified suggesting that the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes required more new genes than did the transition from unicellular to multicellular organization
E,the genome of the model plant arabidopsis thaliana has been sequenced by an international collaboration the arabidopsis genome initiative here we report the complete sequence of chromosome 5 this chromosome is 26 megabases long it is the second largest arabidopsis chromosome and represents 21 of the sequenced regions of the genome the sequence of chromosomes 2 and 4 have been reported previously and that of chromosomes 1 and 3 together with an analysis of the complete genome sequence are reported in this issue analysis of the sequence of chromosome 5 yields further insights into centromere structure and the sequence determinants of heterochromatin condensation the 5874 genes encoded on chromosome 5 reveal several new functions in plants and the patterns of gene organization provide insights into the mechanisms and extent of genome evolution in plants
E,a novel human gene has been identified by in-depth bioinformatics analysis of chromosome 21 segment 40105 21q211 with no coding region predicted in any previous analysis brain-derived dna complementary to rna cdna sequencing predicts a 154-amino acid product with no similarity to any known protein the gene has been named cysteine and tyrosine-rich protein 1 gene symbol cysteine and tyrosine-rich 1 cyyr1 the cyyr1 messenger rna was found by northern blot analysis in a broad range of tissues two transcripts of 34 and 22 kb the gene consists of four exons and spans about 107 kb including a very large intron of 858 kb analysis of expressed sequence tags shows high cyyr1 expression in cells belonging to the amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation system we also cloned the cdna of the murine ortholog cyyr1 which was mapped by a radiation hybrid panel on chromosome 16 within the region corresponding to that containing the respective human homolog on chromosome 21 sequence and phylogenetic analysis led to identification of several genes encoding cyyr1 homologous proteins the most prominent feature identified in the protein family is a central unique cysteine and tyrosine-rich domain which is strongly conserved from lower vertebrates fishes to humans but is absent in bacteria and invertebrates
A,we report the complete sequence of an extreme halophile halobacterium sp nrc-1 harboring a dynamic 2571010-bp genome containing 91 insertion sequences representing 12 families and organized into a large chromosome and 2 related minichromosomes the halobacterium nrc-1 genome codes for 2630 predicted proteins 36 of which are unrelated to any previously reported analysis of the genome sequence shows the presence of pathways for uptake and utilization of amino acids active sodium-proton antiporter and potassium uptake systems sophisticated photosensory and signal transduction pathways and dna replication transcription and translation systems resembling more complex eukaryotic organisms whole proteome comparisons show the definite archaeal nature of this halophile with additional similarities to the gram-positive bacillus subtilis and other bacteria the ease of culturing halobacterium and the availability of methods for its genetic manipulation in the laboratory including construction of gene knockouts and replacements indicate this halophile can serve as an excellent model system among the archaea
E,the national institutes of health mammalian gene collection mgc program is a multiinstitutional effort to identify and sequence a cdna clone containing a complete orf for each human and mouse gene ests were generated from libraries enriched for full-length cdnas and analyzed to identify candidate full-orf clones which then were sequenced to high accuracy the mgc has currently sequenced and verified the full orf for a nonredundant set of 9000 human and 6000 mouse genes candidate full-orf clones for an additional 7800 human and 3500 mouse genes also have been identified all mgc sequences and clones are available without restriction through public databases and clone distribution networks see httpmgcncinihgov

E,bullous pemphigoid antigen 1 bpag1 is a member of the plakin family with cytoskeletal linker properties mutations in bpag1 cause sensory neuron degeneration and skin fragility in mice we have analyzed the bpag1 locus in detail and found that it encodes different interaction domains that are combined in tissue-specific manners these domains include an actin-binding domain abd a plakin domain a coiled coil cc rod domain two different potential intermediate filament-binding domains ifbds a spectrin repeat sr-containing rod domain and a microtubule-binding domain mtbd there are at least three major forms of bpag1 bpag1-e 302 kd bpag1-a 615 kd and bpag1-b 834 kd bpag1-e has been described previously and consists of the plakin domain the cc rod domain and the first ifbd it is the primary epidermal bpag1 isoform and its absence that is the likely cause of skin fragility in mutant mice bpag1-a is the major isoform in the nervous system and a homologue of the microtubule actin cross-linking factor macf bpag1-a is composed of the abd the plakin domain the sr-containing rod domain and the mtbd the absence of bpag1-a is the likely cause of sensory neurodegeneration in mutant mice bpag1-b is highly expressed in muscles and has extra exons encoding a second ifbd between the plakin and sr-containing rod domains of bpag1-a
E,a schizosaccharomyces pombe cdna encoding lanosterol synthase was cloned by complementing a saccharomyces cerevisiae lanosterol synthase mutant the predicted 83-kda protein is 54-58 identical to other lanosterol synthases the previously known lanosterol synthases contain 229 conserved residues which should encompass the catalytically essential amino acids this number is decreased dramatically by including the sc pombe lanosterol synthase in the analysis 42 residues are no longer conserved and therefore are catalytically nonessential we have begun mutagenic studies to identify catalytic residues from the remaining conserved residues mutant sa cerevisiae lanosterol synthase genes were generated in which phenylalanine was specifically substituted for conserved tryptophan residues all of the resultant mutant enzymes retained the ability to complement the sc cerevisiae lanosterol synthase mutant suggesting that these conserved tryptophan residues are not catalytically essential
E,the bm88 antigen is a neuron-specific molecule widely distributed in the mammalian nervous system it is a 22-kda apparently not glycosylated integral membrane protein which appears early during brain development and remains at high levels in the mature animal here we describe the cdna cloning of the porcine bm88 antigen and present evidence that this protein is involved in neuroblastoma cell differentiation the deduced protein is a novel molecule consisting of 140 amino acids and bears a putative transmembrane domain at the cooh-terminal region the mrna of this protein is expressed only in neural tissues where it is restricted to neurons stably transfected neuro-2a cells overexpressing the bm88 antigen exhibited a significant change in morphology reflected by enhanced process outgrowth and a slower rate of division moreover in the presence of differentiation agents such as sucrose and retinoic acid an accelerated differentiation of the transfected neuro-2a cells was observed especially in the presence of sucrose the consequent overexpression of the bm88 antigen in the transfected cells resulted in their enhanced morphological differentiation accompanied by the induction of neurofilament protein expression our results suggest that the bm88 antigen plays a role in the differentiation of neuroblastoma cells
E,the maintenance of a stable extracellular concentration of ionized calcium depends on the integrated function of a number of specialized cells eg parathyroid and certain kidney epithelial cells we recently identified another g protein-coupled receptor bopcari from bovine parathyroid that responds to changes in extracellular ca2 within the millimolar range and provides a key mechanism for regulating the secretion of parathyroid hormone using an homology-based strategy we now report the isolation of a cdna encoding an extracellular ca2polyvalent cation-sensing receptor rakcar from rat kidney the predicted rakcar protein shares 92 identity with bopcar1 receptor and features a seven membrane-spanning domain characteristic of the g protein-coupled receptors which is preceded by a large hydrophilic extracellular nh2 terminus believed to be involved in cation binding rakcar crna-injected xenopus oocytes responded to extracellular ca2 mg2 gd3 and neomycin with characteristic activation of inositol phospholipid-dependent intracellular ca2-induced cl- currents in rat kidney northern analysis revealed rakcar transcripts of 4 and 7 kb and in situ hybridization showed localization primarily in outer medulla and cortical medullary rays our results provide important insights into the molecular structure of an extracellular ca2polyvalent cation-sensing receptor in rat kidney and provide another basis on which to understand the role of extracellular divalent cations in regulating kidney function in mineral metabolism
E,many plants as well as other organisms accumulate betaine nnn-trimethylglycine as a nontoxic or protective osmolyte under saline or dry conditions in plants the last step in betaine synthesis is catalyzed by betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase badh ec 1218 a nuclear-encoded chloroplastic enzyme a cdna clone for badh 1812 base pairs was selected from a lambda gt10 cdna library derived from leaves of salt-stressed spinach spinacia oleracea l the library was screened with oligonucleotide probes corresponding to amino acid sequences of two peptides prepared from purified badh the authenticity of the clone was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis this analysis demonstrated the presence of a 1491-base-pair open reading frame that contained sequences encoding 12 peptide fragments of badh the clone hybridized to a 19-kilobase mrna from spinach leaves this mrna was more abundant in salt-stressed plants consistent with the known salt induction of badh activity the amino acid sequence deduced from the badh cdna sequence showed substantial similarities to those for nonspecific aldehyde dehydrogenases ec 1213 and ec 1215 from several sources including absolute conservation of a decapeptide in the probable active site comparison of deduced and determined amino acid sequences indicated that the transit peptide may comprise only 7 or 8 residues which is atypically short for precursors to stromal proteins
E,arsenic is a human carcinogen whose mechanism of action is unknown previously this laboratory demonstrated that arsenite acts as a comutagen by interfering with dna repair although a specific dna repair enzyme sensitive to arsenite has not been identified a number of stable arsenite-sensitive and arsenite-resistant sublines of chinese hamster v79 cells have now been isolated in order to gain understanding of possible targets for arsenite's action one arsenite-resistant subline asr28a was chosen as a donor for a cdna expression library the library from arsenite-induced asr28a cells was transfected into arsenite-sensitive ass5 cells and transfectants were selected for arsenite-resistance two cdnas asr1 and asr2 which confer arsenite resistance to arsenite-hypersensitive ass5 cells as well as to wild-type cells were isolated asr1 shows almost complete homology with the rat fau gene a tumor suppressor gene which contains a ubiquitin-like region fused to s30 ribosomal protein arsenite was previously shown to inhibit ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis these results suggest that the tumor suppressor fau gene product or some other aspect of the ubiquitin system may be a target for arsenic toxicity and that disruption of the ubiquitin system may contribute to the genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of arsenite
E,mouse plasma alpha-2-macroglobulin m alpha 2m was isolated and the n-terminal amino-acid sequences determined after separation of the 165-kda and 35-kda subunits these sequences were compared to the protein sequence predicted by the cdna which was cloned from a mouse liver library and sequenced from these data it is evident that both subunits are encoded by one mrna of approximately 5 kb expressed predominantly in liver the smaller subunit with the n-terminal sequence dlsssdlt comprises the c-terminal 257 residues of m alpha 2m and is derived from a single-chain precursor probably by proteolytic processing at an arginine residue in the sequence ptrdlss analysis of the predicted protein further showed all the salient features of a proteinase inhibitor of the macroglobulin family a bait region that deviates from all known sequences in this family a very conserved internal thiolester site and conserved cysteine residues and putative n-glycosylation sites the synthesis of m alpha 2m in adult liver was demonstrated by northern blotting and in fetal liver by in-situ hybridization transient transfection of cos cells with the cdna under control of a viral promoter demonstrated the secretion and partial processing of m alpha 2m in the culture medium in plasma the level of m alpha 2m was found to be stable as expected for the murine counterpart of human plasma alpha-2-macroglobulin the possibilities of using the mouse as a genetic model to study this proteinase inhibitor in vivo are discussed
E,the ahr locus encodes for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr which plays an important toxicological and developmental role sequence variation in this gene was studied in 13 different mouse lines that included eight laboratory strains two mus musculus subspecies and three additional mus species the data presented represent the largest study of sequence variation across multiple mouse lines in a single gene approximately equal to 159 kbmouse line among all mice the average frequency of all polymorphisms in the intronic regions was 203 variantskb and the average exonic frequency was 141 variantskb for substitutions alone the average frequencies in the intronic and exonic regions for all mice were 133 and 89 substitutionskb respectively between laboratory strains the average intronic and exonic frequencies for all polymorphisms dropped to 54 and 29 variantskb respectively there were 111 non-synonymous polymorphisms that resulted in 42 different amino acid changes of which only 10 amino acid changes had been previously identified based on the nucleotide sequence the phylogenetic history of the gene showed mice from the ahrb2 and ahrd alleles in separate branches while mice from the ahrb1 and ahrb3 alleles exhibited a more complex history evolutionarily the ahr protein as a whole appears to be under purifying selective pressure ka  ks ratio  0237 despite significant functional constraint in the basic helix-loop-helix and pas domains ligand binding is not constrained to the high-affinity allele which supports further the role of the ahr in development and its importance beyond the adaptive response to environmental toxicants
A,the complete sequence of the genome of a hyper-thermophilic archaebacterium pyrococcus horikoshii ot3 has been determined by assembling the sequences of the physical map-based contigs of fosmid clones and of long polymerase chain reaction pcr products which were used for gap-filling the entire length of the genome was 1738505 bp the authenticity of the entire genome sequence was supported by restriction analysis of long pcr products which were directly amplified from the genomic dna as the potential protein-coding regions a total of 2061 open reading frames orfs were assigned and by similarity search against public databases 406 197 were related to genes with putative function and 453 220 to the sequences registered but with unknown function the remaining 1202 orfs 583 did not show any significant similarity to the sequences in the databases sequence comparison among the assigned orfs in the genome provided evidence that a considerable number of orfs were generated by sequence duplication by similarity search 11 orfs were assumed to contain the intein elements the rna genes identified were a single 16s-23s rrna operon two 5s rrna genes and 46 trna genes including two with the intron structure all the assigned orfs and rna coding regions occupied 9125 of the whole genome the data presented in this paper are available on the internet at httpwwwnitegojp
E,although all intermediate-size filaments 10-nm filaments seem to show similar morphology and share a number of biochemical properties different cell- and tissue-specific subclasses have been distinguished by immunological experiments and by differences in apparent molecular weights and isoelectric points of the major constituent proteins in order to understand the degree of possible homology between these proteins we have begun amino acid sequence analysis of the polypeptides here we characterize a large fragment of chicken gizzard and pig stomach desmin as well as the corresponding fragment from porcine eye lens vimentin the fragments are situated at the carboxyl end and consist of 138-140 amino acid residues--ie some 28 of the corresponding polypeptide chains the results show that the two immunologically distinct porcine proteins are different gene products they show a related amino acid sequence but differ in 36 of the residues present in the carboxy-terminal region thus tissue specificity overrides species divergence these results are discussed in the light of previous immunological experiments they lend further support to the hypothesis that intermediate filaments belong to a multigene family which is expressed in line with certain rules of differentiation during embryogenesis
E,to understand the mechanism of the maturation of various proteins in protein-storage vacuoles we purified a 48-kda aspartic endopeptidase composed of 32-kda and 16-kda subunits from castor bean immunocytochemical and cell fractionation analyses of the endosperm of maturing castor bean seed showed that the aspartic endopeptidase was localized in the matrix of the protein-storage vacuoles where a variety of seed storage proteins were also present the amount of the aspartic endopeptidase increased at the mid-maturation stage of the seeds before accumulation of the storage proteins to determine how the aspartic endopeptidase is responsible for maturation of seed proteins in concert with the vacuolar processing enzyme we prepared 35s-labeled proproteins of seed proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum fraction of pulse-labeled maturing endosperm and used the authentic proproteins as substrates for in vitro processing experiments the purified aspartic endopeptidase was unable to convert any of three endosperm proproteins pro2s albumin proglobulin and proricin into their mature sizes while the purified vacuolar processing enzyme could convert all three proproteins we further examined the activity of aspartic endopeptidase on the cleavage of an internal propeptide of arabidopsis pro2s albumin which is known to be removed post-translationally the aspartic endopeptidase cleaved the propeptide at three sites under acidic conditions these results suggest that aspartic endopeptidase cannot directly convert pro2s albumin into the mature form but it may play a role in trimming the c-terminal propeptides from the subunits that are produced by the action of the vacuolar processing enzyme
A,methanogenesis the biological production of methane plays a pivotal role in the global carbon cycle and contributes significantly to global warming the majority of methane in nature is derived from acetate here we report the complete genome sequence of an acetate-utilizing methanogen methanosarcina acetivorans c2a methanosarcineae are the most metabolically diverse methanogens thrive in a broad range of environments and are unique among the archaea in forming complex multicellular structures this diversity is reflected in the genome of m acetivorans at 5751492 base pairs it is by far the largest known archaeal genome the 4524 open reading frames code for a strikingly wide and unanticipated variety of metabolic and cellular capabilities the presence of novel methyltransferases indicates the likelihood of undiscovered natural energy sources for methanogenesis whereas the presence of single-subunit carbon monoxide dehydrogenases raises the possibility of nonmethanogenic growth although motility has not been observed in any methanosarcineae a flagellin gene cluster and two complete chemotaxis gene clusters were identified the availability of genetic methods coupled with its physiological and metabolic diversity makes m acetivorans a powerful model organism for the study of archaeal biology sequence data annotations and analyses are available at httpwww-genomewimitedu
B,rhizobium meliloti produces an acidic exopolysaccharide termed succinoglycan or eps i that is important for invasion of the nodules that it elicits on its host medicago sativa succinoglycan is a high-molecular-weight polymer composed of repeating octasaccharide subunits these subunits are synthesized on membrane-bound isoprenoid lipid carriers beginning with a galactose residue followed by seven glucose residues and modified by the addition of acetate succinate and pyruvate biochemical characterizations of lipid-linked succinoglycan biosynthetic intermediates from previously identified exo mutant strains have been carried out in our laboratory t l reuber and g c walker cell 74269-280 1993 to determine where each mutation blocks the biosynthetic pathway we have carried out a fine structure genetic analysis of a portion of the cluster of exo genes present on the second symbiotic megaplasmid of r meliloti and have identified several new genes in addition the dna sequence of 16 kb of the exo cluster was determined and the genetic map was correlated with the dna sequence in this paper we present the sequence of a family of glycosyl transferases required for the synthesis of succinoglycan and discuss their functions
B,we present a complete dna sequence and metabolic analysis of the dominant oral bacterium fusobacterium nucleatum although not considered a major dental pathogen on its own this anaerobe facilitates the aggregation and establishment of several other species including the dental pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus the f nucleatum strain atcc 25586 genome was assembled from shotgun sequences and analyzed using the ergo bioinformatics suite httpwwwintegratedgenomicscom the genome contains 217 mb encoding 2067 open reading frames organized on a single circular chromosome with 27 gc content despite its taxonomic position among the gram-negative bacteria several features of its core metabolism are similar to that of gram-positive clostridium spp enterococcus spp and lactococcus spp the genome analysis has revealed several key aspects of the pathways of organic acid amino acid carbohydrate and lipid metabolism nine very-high-molecular-weight outer membrane proteins are predicted from the sequence none of which has been reported in the literature more than 137 transporters for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as peptides sugars metal ions and cofactors have been identified biosynthetic pathways exist for only three amino acids glutamate aspartate and asparagine the remaining amino acids are imported as such or as di- or oligopeptides that are subsequently degraded in the cytoplasm a principal source of energy appears to be the fermentation of glutamate to butyrate additionally desulfuration of cysteine and methionine yields ammonia h2s methyl mercaptan and butyrate which are capable of arresting fibroblast growth thus preventing wound healing and aiding penetration of the gingival epithelium the metabolic capabilities of f nucleatum revealed by its genome are therefore consistent with its specialized niche in the mouth
A,the complete sequence of the genome of an aerobic hyper-thermophilic crenarchaeon aeropyrum pernix k1 which optimally grows at 95 degrees c has been determined by the whole genome shotgun method with some modifications the entire length of the genome was 1669695 bp the authenticity of the entire sequence was supported by restriction analysis of long pcr products which were directly amplified from the genomic dna as the potential protein-coding regions a total of 2694 open reading frames orfs were assigned by similarity search against public databases 633 235 of the orfs were related to genes with putative function and 523 194 to the sequences registered but with unknown function all the genes in the tca cycle except for that of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase were included and instead of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase gene the genes coding for the two subunits of 2-oxoacidferredoxin oxidoreductase were identified the remaining 1538 orfs 571 did not show any significant similarity to the sequences in the databases sequence comparison among the assigned orfs suggested that a considerable member of orfs were generated by sequence duplication the rna genes identified were a single 16s-23s rrna operon two 5s rrna genes and 47 trna genes including 14 genes with intron structures all the assigned orfs and rna coding regions occupied 8912 of the whole genome the data presented in this paper are available on the internet homepage httpwwwmildnitegojp
E,nucleotide sequences of eight est-5a and est-5c genes corresponding to previously sequenced est-5b genes in drosophila pseudoobscura were determined to compare patterns of polymorphism and divergence among members of this small gene family the three esterase genes were also sequenced from d persimilis and d miranda for interspecific comparisons the data provide evidence that gene conversion between loci contributes to polymorphism and to the homogenization of the est5 genes for est-5b which encodes one of the most highly polymorphic proteins in drosophila 12 of the segregating amino acid variants appear to have been introduced via gene conversion from other members of the gene family interlocus gene conversion can also explain high sequence similarity especially at synonymous sites between est-5b and est-5a tests of neutrality using interspecific comparisons show that levels of polymorphism conform to neutral expectations at each est-5 locus however mcdonald-kreitman tests based on intraspecific gene comparisons indicate that positive selection on amino acids has accompanied est-5 gene duplication and divergence in d pseudoobscura
B,we present here the complete genome sequence of a common avian clone of pasteurella multocida pm70 the genome of pm70 is a single circular chromosome 2257487 base pairs in length and contains 2014 predicted coding regions 6 ribosomal rna operons and 57 trnas genome-scale evolutionary analyses based on pairwise comparisons of 1197 orthologous sequences between p multocida haemophilus influenzae and escherichia coli suggest that p multocida and h influenzae diverged approximately 270 million years ago and the gamma subdivision of the proteobacteria radiated about 680 million years ago two previously undescribed open reading frames accounting for approximately 1 of the genome encode large proteins with homology to the virulence-associated filamentous hemagglutinin of bordetella pertussis consistent with the critical role of iron in the survival of many microbial pathogens in silico and whole-genome microarray analyses identified more than 50 pm70 genes with a potential role in iron acquisition and metabolism overall the complete genomic sequence and preliminary functional analyses provide a foundation for future research into the mechanisms of pathogenesis and host specificity of this important multispecies pathogen
B,the 2160837-base pair genome sequence of an isolate of streptococcus pneumoniae a gram-positive pathogen that causes pneumonia bacteremia meningitis and otitis media contains 2236 predicted coding regions of these 1440 64 were assigned a biological role approximately 5 of the genome is composed of insertion sequences that may contribute to genome rearrangements through uptake of foreign dna extracellular enzyme systems for the metabolism of polysaccharides and hexosamines provide a substantial source of carbon and nitrogen for s pneumoniae and also damage host tissues and facilitate colonization a motif identified within the signal peptide of proteins is potentially involved in targeting these proteins to the cell surface of low-guaninecytosine gc gram-positive species several surface-exposed proteins that may serve as potential vaccine candidates were identified comparative genome hybridization with dna arrays revealed strain differences in s pneumoniae that could contribute to differences in virulence and antigenicity
B,leprosy a chronic human neurological disease results from infection with the obligate intracellular pathogen mycobacterium leprae a close relative of the tubercle bacillus mycobacterium leprae has the longest doubling time of all known bacteria and has thwarted every effort at culture in the laboratory comparing the 327-megabase mb genome sequence of an armadillo-derived indian isolate of the leprosy bacillus with that of mycobacterium tuberculosis 441 mb provides clear explanations for these properties and reveals an extreme case of reductive evolution less than half of the genome contains functional genes but pseudogenes with intact counterparts in m tuberculosis abound genome downsizing and the current mosaic arrangement appear to have resulted from extensive recombination events between dispersed repetitive sequences gene deletion and decay have eliminated many important metabolic activities including siderophore production part of the oxidative and most of the microaerophilic and anaerobic respiratory chains and numerous catabolic systems and their regulatory circuits
E,a molecular phylogeny of the subfamily antilopinae was determined using the two mitochondrial dna mtdna genes cytochrome b and cytochrome c oxidase iii the tribe antilopini is monophyletic with antidorcas marsupialis and litocranius walleri basal to the large genus gazella antilope cervicapra falls within gazella this placement would either make gazella paraphyletic or require that the genus name gazella be changed to antilope gazella thomsonii is supported as a subspecies of g rufifrons most members of the tribe neotragini are sister species to the antilopini but the neotragini is rendered paraphyletic by a deep placement of neotragus moschatus
B,comparison of two fully sequenced genomes of buchnera aphidicola the obligate endosymbionts of aphids reveals the most extreme genome stability to date no chromosome rearrangements or gene acquisitions have occurred in the past 50 to 70 million years despite substantial sequence evolution and the inactivation and loss of individual genes in contrast the genomes of their closest free-living relatives escherichia coli and salmonella spp are more than 2000-fold more labile in content and gene order the genomic stasis of b aphidicola likely attributable to the loss of phages repeated sequences and reca indicates that b aphidicola is no longer a source of ecological innovation for its hosts
B,pseudomonas aeruginosa strains infecting patients with cystic fibrosis cf acquire a mucoid phenotype due to overproduction of alginate the key enzyme in alginate synthesis is algd whose promoter is transcriptionally active in mucoid strains and under the control of several trans-acting factors including the integration host factor ihf the algd promoter palgd contains two ihf-binding sites ihf1 and ihf2 study of ihf binding to ihf2 of palgd by electrophoretic mobility-shift assays led to the discovery of a protein of 36 kda p36 able to bind downstream from ihf2 to the 3' region of palgd the gene encoding p36 was isolated from the mucoid strain cha of p aeruginosa and sequenced it can encode a 324-amino-acid protein which shares a high degree of sequence identity 63 with cysb from escherichia coli and from salmonella typhimurium a transcriptional factor of the lysr superfamily furthermore both p36 and s typhimurium cysb bind the same site of palgd p36 was therefore termed cysb and its structural gene was called cysb next to cysb on the opposite dna strand cysh was capable of encoding a protein sharing 26 identity with cysh paps reductase of e coli and an even greater identity 54 with the nucleotide-deduced protein from arabidopsis a cysb-deficient mutant of cha constructed by insertional inactivation of cysb was a cysteine auxotroph and was unable to form a specific complex with palgd in vitro activity of palgd in the cysb mutant in cha and in the non-mucoid strain pao was assessed by the use of a transcriptional algd-xyle fusion cells of pao and of the cysb mutant grown in minimal media in the presence of 03 m nacl exhibited a palgd activity which was 10 or less that of the mucoid strain cha thus p aeruginosa cysb can act as an activator of algd expression
E,the sequence of the mtdna of the grey seal halichoerus grypus was determined the length of the molecule was 16797 base pairs the organization of the molecule conformed with that of other eutherian mammals but the control region was unusually long due to the presence of two types of repeated motifs the grey seal and the previously reported harbor seal phoca vitulina belong to different but closely related genera of family phocidae true or earless seals in order to determine the degree of differences that may occur between mtdnas of closely related mammalian genera the 2 rrna genes the 13 peptide coding genes and the 22 trna genes of the 2 species were compared total nucleotide difference in the peptide coding genes was 20-61 the range of conservative difference was 00-15 in the inferred peptide sequences the amino acid difference was 00-45 and the difference with respect to chemical properties of amino acids was 00-30 a gene that showed a limited degree of difference in one mode of comparison did not necessarily show a corresponding limited difference in another mode the ratio for differences in codon positions 1 2 and 3 was approximately 27116 the corresponding ratio for conservative differences was approximately 18111 the evolutionary separation of the two species was calculated to have taken place 2-25 million years ago this dating gives the figure approximately 8 x 10-9 as the mean rate of substitution per site and year in the entire mtdna molecule comparison with the cytochrome b gene of the hawaiian monk seal and the weddell seal suggested that the lineage of these two species and that of the grey and harbor seals separated approximately 8 million years ago
B,bavaricin mn was purified from lactobacillus sake culture supernatant 135-fold with a final yield of 11 sequence analysis revealed bavaricin mn to be a 42-amino-acid peptide having a molecular weight of 4769 and a calculated pi of 100 computer analysis indicated that the c-terminal region may form an alpha-helical structure with an amphipathic nature deemed important in the interaction of bacteriocins with biological membranes bavaricin mn rapidly depleted the membrane potential delta p of energized listeria monocytogenes cells in a concentration-dependent fashion at a bavaricin mn concentration of 90 microgramsml the delta p decreased by 85 both the electrical potential delta psi and z delta ph components of the delta p were depleted and this depletion was not dependent on a threshold level of proton motive force in addition to studying the effect of bavaricin mn on the delta p of vegetative cells bavaricin mn-induced carboxyfluorescein cf efflux from l monocytogenes-derived lipid vesicles was also characterized bavaricin mn-induced cf leakage was also concentration dependent with an optimum of ph 60 the rate of cf efflux was 63 greater in lipid vesicles in which a delta psi was generated compared with that in lipid vesicles in the absence of a delta psi
B,nitrosomonas europaea atcc 19718 is a gram-negative obligate chemolithoautotroph that can derive all its energy and reductant for growth from the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite nitrosomonas europaea participates in the biogeochemical n cycle in the process of nitrification its genome consists of a single circular chromosome of 2812094 bp the gc skew analysis indicates that the genome is divided into two unequal replichores genes are distributed evenly around the genome with approximately 47 transcribed from one strand and approximately 53 transcribed from the complementary strand a total of 2460 protein-encoding genes emerged from the modeling effort averaging 1011 bp in length with intergenic regions averaging 117 bp genes necessary for the catabolism of ammonia energy and reductant generation biosynthesis and co2 and nh3 assimilation were identified in contrast genes for catabolism of organic compounds are limited genes encoding transporters for inorganic ions were plentiful whereas genes encoding transporters for organic molecules were scant complex repetitive elements constitute ca 5 of the genome among these are 85 predicted insertion sequence elements in eight different families the strategy of n europaea to accumulate fe from the environment involves several classes of fe receptors with more than 20 genes devoted to these receptors however genes for the synthesis of only one siderophore citrate were identified in the genome this genome has provided new insights into the growth and metabolism of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria
E,despite their high degree of genomic similarity reminiscent of their relatively recent separation from each other  approximately 6 million years ago the molecular basis of traits unique to humans vs their closest relative the chimpanzee is largely unknown this report describes a large-scale single-contig comparison between human and chimpanzee genomes via the sequence analysis of almost one-half of the immunologically critical mhc this 1750601-bp stretch of dna which encompasses the entire class i along with the telomeric part of the mhc class iii regions corresponds to an orthologous 1870955 bp of the human hla region sequence analysis confirms the existence of a high degree of sequence similarity between the two species however and importantly this 986 sequence identity drops to only 867 taking into account the multiple insertionsdeletions indels dispersed throughout the region this is functionally exemplified by a large deletion of 95 kb between the virtual locations of human mica and micb genes which results in a single hybrid chimpanzee mic gene in a segment of the mhc genetically linked to species-specific handling of several viral infections hivsiv hepatitis b and c as well as susceptibility to various autoimmune diseases finally if generalized these data suggest that evolution may have used the mechanistically more drastic indels instead of the more subtle single-nucleotide substitutions for shaping the recently emerged primate species
B,almost all aphid species homoptera insecta have 60-80 huge cells called bacteriocytes within which are round-shaped bacteria that are designated buchnera these bacteria are maternally transmitted to eggs and embryos through host generations and the mutualism between the host and the bacteria is so obligate that neither can reproduce independently buchnera is a close relative of escherichia coli but it contains more than 100 genomic copies per cell and its genome size is only a seventh of that of e coli here we report the complete genome sequence of buchnera sp strain aps which is composed of one 640681-base-pair chromosome and two small plasmids there are genes for the biosyntheses of amino acids essential for the hosts in the genome but those for non-essential amino acids are missing indicating complementarity and syntrophy between the host and the symbiont in addition buchnera lacks genes for the biosynthesis of cell-surface components including lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids regulator genes and genes involved in defence of the cell these results indicate that buchnera is completely symbiotic and viable only in its limited niche the bacteriocyte
B,the human pathogen tropheryma whipplei is the only known reduced genome species 601 mb within the actinobacteria high gc gram-positive bacteria we present the sequence of the 927303-bp circular genome of t whipplei twist strain encoding 808 predicted protein-coding genes specific genome features include deficiencies in amino acid metabolisms the lack of clear thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase homologs and a mutation in dna gyrase predicting a resistance to quinolone antibiotics moreover the alignment of the two available t whipplei genome sequences twist vs tw0827 revealed a large chromosomal inversion the extremities of which are located within two paralogous genes these genes belong to a large cell-surface protein family defined by the presence of a common repeat highly conserved at the nucleotide level the repeats appear to trigger frequent genome rearrangements in t whipplei potentially resulting in the expression of different subsets of cell surface proteins this might represent a new mechanism for evading host defenses the t whipplei genome sequence was also compared to other reduced bacterial genomes to examine the generality of previously detected features the analysis of the genome sequence of this previously largely unknown human pathogen is now guiding the development of molecular diagnostic tools and more convenient culture conditions
B,the nucleotide sequence of the pet operon of rhodopseudomonas capsulata strain sb1003 has been determined this operon consists of the peta petb and petc genes which encode the rieske fe-s protein cytochrome b and cytochrome c1 respectively all components of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c2 oxidoreductase the deduced amino acid sequences of the pet genes show homology to the corresponding proteins from other organisms and particularly high homologies over 90 for amino acid and nucleotide sequences to the previously described fbc operon from a strain previously identified as rhodopseudomonas spheroides ga the amino acid sequences of the pet proteins are discussed with reference to the structure and function of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c2 oxidoreductase
V,the complete sequence of a singapore isolate of odontoglossum ringspot virus orsv-s1 comprises 6609 nucleotides nt and four open reading frames orfs 1 to 4 the 126183-kda rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp 33-kda movement protein mp and 18-kda coat protein cp cistrons are located at nt 63-34014901 4807-5718 and 5721-6197 on the genome respectively the 5' utr contains three copies of an 8-base direct repeat and caan motifs characteristic trna-like structure and three consecutive homologous regions were present in the 3' utr the genomic rna and mp of orsv-s1 are one of the longest among all members of the tov group phylogenetic analysis of all four genes indicates evolutionary divergence but within each gene there are some degrees of evolutionary convergence the conserved amino acid sequences in the mp can be used for the classification of tobamoviruses
E,the polypeptide dbi diazepam-binding inhibitor has been purified from the porcine upper intestine where it is abundant porcine mature dbi is composed of 86 amino acid residues and has a blocked n-terminus the primary structure the first dbi structure determined at the protein level differs from those indirectly deduced for human and rat dbi at 11 and 17 positions respectively in total the three mammalian dbis differ at 22 positions but have exactly identical c-terminal 11-residue segments highly charged and ending with c-terminal isoleucine the porcine dbi inhibits both the early and the late phase of glucose-induced insulin release from the isolated perfused rat pancreas thus the results identify by direct analysis the presence of dbi at a non-cerebral localization gut establish a novel structural form porcine and demonstrate a novel bioactivity on insulin release these aspects are of special interest in relation to the conserved segments including the one at the c-terminal end which may constitute functionally important parts of the polypeptide it is possible that dbi belongs to a new family of gut polypeptides which inhibit glucose-mediated insulin release by hormonal andor neurocrine mechanisms
E,the two idiomorphic alleles called mat and mat- which control the mating types in podospora anserina have been cloned mat and mat- encompass 38 kb and 47 kb respectively of unrelated dna sequences flanked by common sequences subcloning allowed the identification and localization in each locus of the gene that controls fertilization probably by determining the mating type the mat gene called fpr1 encodes a protein with a potential dna-binding hmg domain the presence of this motif suggests that the fpr1 polypeptide may act as a transcriptional factor the mat- gene called fmr1 encodes a protein containing a motif that is also found in proteins controlling mating functions in saccharomyces cerevisiae and neurospora crassa the role of this motif has not yet been established unlike the mat locus where the fpr1 gene seems to represent the major information the mat- locus contains information necessary for the post-fertilization steps of the sexual cycle besides the fmr1 gene
B,background vibrio parahaemolyticus a gram-negative marine bacterium is a worldwide cause of food-borne gastroenteritis v parahaemolyticus strains of a few specific serotypes probably derived from a common clonal ancestor have lately caused a pandemic of gastroenteritis the organism is phylogenetically close to v cholerae the causative agent of cholera methods the whole genome sequence of a clinical v parahaemolyticus strain rimd2210633 was established by shotgun sequencing the coding sequences were identified by use of gambler and glimmer programs comparative analysis with the v cholerae genome was undertaken with mummer findings the genome consisted of two circular chromosomes of 3288558 bp and 1877212 bp it contained 4832 genes comparison of the v parahaemolyticus genome with that of v cholerae showed many rearrangements within and between the two chromosomes genes for the type iii secretion system ttss were identified in the genome of v parahaemolyticus v cholerae does not have these genes interpretation the ttss is a central virulence factor of diarrhoea-causing bacteria such as shigella salmonella and enteropathogenic escherichia coli which cause gastroenteritis by invading or intimately interacting with intestinal epithelial cells our results suggest that v parahaemolyticus and v cholerae use distinct mechanisms to establish infection this finding explains clinical features of v parahaemolyticus infections which commonly include inflammatory diarrhoea and in some cases systemic manifestations such as septicaemia distinct from those of v cholerae infections which are generally associated with non-inflammatory diarrhoea
V,the nucleotide sequence of sv40 dna was determined and the sequence was correlated with known genes of the virus and with the structure of viral messenger rna's there is a limited overlap of the coding regions for structural proteins and a complex pattern of leader sequences at the 5' end of late messenger rna the sequence of the early region is consistent with recent proposals that the large early polypeptide of sv40 is encoded in noncontinguous segments of dna
E,heat shock protein 70 kda hsp70 family molecular chaperones play critical roles in protein folding and trafficking in all eukaryotic cells the mechanisms by which hsp70 family chaperones are regulated however are only partly understood bag-1 binds the atpase domains of hsp70 and hsc70 modulating their chaperone activity and functioning as a competitive antagonist of the co-chaperone hip we describe the identification of a family of bag-1-related proteins from humans bag-2 bag-3 bag-4 bag-5 the invertebrate caenorhabditis elegans bag-1 bag-2 and the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe bag-1a bag-1b these proteins all contain a conserved approximately 45-amino acid region near their c termini the bag domain that binds hsc70hsp70 but they differ widely in their n-terminal domains the human bag-1 bag-2 and bag-3 proteins bind with high affinity kd congruent with 1-10 nm to the atpase domain of hsc70 and inhibit its chaperone activity in a hip-repressible manner the findings suggest opportunities for specification and diversification of hsp70hsc70 chaperone functions through interactions with various bag-family proteins
B,both virulent and benign isolates of the ovine pathogen dichelobacter bacteroides nodosus produce polar fimbriae which have been implicated in twitching motility the fimbrial subunit-encoding genes from two virulent and two benign serogroup-b isolates of d nodosus were cloned and sequenced analysis of the deduced amino acid aa sequences of these subunits indicated the presence of substitutions that appeared to correlate with the virulence phenotype however these aa substitutions were located in variable regions of the protein where they are unlikely to alter the functional properties of the fimbriae the aa sequences of the serogroup-b subunits had a very high level 91-95 of similarity particularly at the n terminus where the conserved region extended up to aa 61 specific aa substitutions within the subunit of one isolate may reflect its serotypic variation from the other serogroup-b subunits studied
A,methanogenesis the biological production of methane plays a pivotal role in the global carbon cycle and contributes significantly to global warming the majority of methane in nature is derived from acetate here we report the complete genome sequence of an acetate-utilizing methanogen methanosarcina acetivorans c2a methanosarcineae are the most metabolically diverse methanogens thrive in a broad range of environments and are unique among the archaea in forming complex multicellular structures this diversity is reflected in the genome of m acetivorans at 5751492 base pairs it is by far the largest known archaeal genome the 4524 open reading frames code for a strikingly wide and unanticipated variety of metabolic and cellular capabilities the presence of novel methyltransferases indicates the likelihood of undiscovered natural energy sources for methanogenesis whereas the presence of single-subunit carbon monoxide dehydrogenases raises the possibility of nonmethanogenic growth although motility has not been observed in any methanosarcineae a flagellin gene cluster and two complete chemotaxis gene clusters were identified the availability of genetic methods coupled with its physiological and metabolic diversity makes m acetivorans a powerful model organism for the study of archaeal biology sequence data annotations and analyses are available at httpwww-genomewimitedu
E,using the technique of subtractive hybridization natural killer nk minus t helper cell line jurkat a human cdna clone named b2-1 was isolated and sequenced b2-1 transcripts are highly expressed in nk and peripheral t cells but not in the t helper cell line used in the subtraction two overlapping cdna clones contained 3309 bp in agreement with a predicted size of 32 kb obtained by northern blot analysis the cdna contained a 5' open reading frame encoding a 398 amino acid aa protein with a calculated mr of 46383 the protein contains n-linked glycosylation sites and a site for phosphorylation by protein kinase c database homology searches show that the deduced protein is novel and has three discrete domains with significant homology to several structural proteins the most striking homology was to yeast sec7 in the central domain of the gene 57 identical over 466 bp and also the protein level 42 identical amino acids 39 conserved amino acids sec7 is a large protein 2008 amino acids found on golgi vesicles that plays a role in protein transport
E,in petunia flowers the loci an1 an2 and an11 control the pigmentation of the flower by stimulating the transcription of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes the an1 and an2 locus were recently cloned and encode a basic helix-loop-helix bhlh and myb-domain transcriptional activator respectively here we report the isolation of the an11 locus by transposon tagging rna gel blot experiments show that an11 is expressed independently from an1 and an2 throughout plant development as well as in tissues that do not express the anthocyanin pathway it encodes a novel wd-repeat protein that is highly conserved even in species that do not produce anthocyanins such as yeast nematodes and mammals the observation that the human an11 homolog partially complements the an11 petunia mutant in transient assays shows that sequence similarity reflects functional conservation overexpression of an2 in an11- petals restored the activity of a structural anthocyanin gene in transient assays indicating that an11 acts upstream of an2 cell fractionation experiments show that the bulk of the an11 protein is localized in the cytoplasm taken together this indicates that an11 is a cytoplasmic component of a conserved signal transduction cascade that modulates an2 function in petunia thereby linking cellular signals with transcriptional activation
E,a cdna for aspergillus oryzae glucoamylase was cloned using oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes derived from amino sequences of peptide fragments of the enzyme the glucoamylase cdna when introduced into saccharomyces cerevisiae directed the secretion of active glucoamylase into the culture medium the complete nucleotide sequence of the cdna contained an open reading frame encoding 612 amino acid residues comparative studies with other fungal glucoamylases showed homologies of 67 with a niger and 30 with rhizopus oryzae of the deduced amino acid sequences in the five conserved regions reported in other fungal glucoamylases the levels of homologies between those regions of a oryzae and a niger enzymes were much higher 78-94 a oryzae glucoamylase contained no peptide region abundant in threonine and serine residue ts-region like that proposed to adsorb onto raw starch in a awamori var kawachii glucoamylase
E,resistance to azole antifungal agents in candida albicans can be mediated by multidrug efflux transporters in a previous study we identified at least two such transporters cdr1p and benp which belong to the class of atp-binding cassette abc transporters and of major facilitators respectively to isolate additional factors potentially responsible for resistance to azole antifungal agents in c albicans the hypersusceptibility of a saccharomyces cerevisiae multidrug transporter mutant delta pdr5 to these agents was complemented with a c albicans genomic library several new genes were isolated one of which was a new abc transporter gene called cdr2 candida drug resistance the protein cdr2p encoded by this gene exhibited 84 identity with cdr1p and could confer resistance to azole antifungal agents to other antifungals terbinafine amorolfine and to a variety of metabolic inhibitors the disruption of cdr2 in the c albicans strain caf4-2 did not render cells more susceptible to these substances when the disruption of cdr2 was performed in the background of a mutant in which cdr1 was deleted the resulting double delta cdr1 delta cdr2 mutant was more susceptible to these agents than the single delta cdr1 mutant the absence of hypersusceptibility of the single delta cdr2 mutant could be explained by the absence of cdr2 mrna in azole-susceptible c albicans strains cdr2 was overexpressed however in clinical c albicans isolates resistant to azole antifungal agents as described previously for cdr1 but to levels exceeding or equal to those reached by cdr1 interestingly cdr2 expression was restored in delta cdr1 mutants reverting spontaneously to wild-type levels of susceptibility to azole antifungal agents these data demonstrate that cdr2 plays an important role in mediating the resistance of c albicans to azole antifungal agents
B,the complete nucleotide sequence 580070 base pairs of the mycoplasma genitalium genome the smallest known genome of any free-living organism has been determined by whole-genome random sequencing and assembly a total of only 470 predicted coding regions were identified that include genes required for dna replication transcription and translation dna repair cellular transport and energy metabolism comparison of this genome to that of haemophilus influenzae suggests that differences in genome content are reflected as profound differences in physiology and metabolic capacity between these two organisms
B,genome sequences are available for many bacterial strains but there has been little progress in using these data to understand the molecular basis of pathogen emergence and differences in strain virulence serotype m3 strains of group a streptococcus gas are a common cause of severe invasive infections with unusually high rates of morbidity and mortality to gain insight into the molecular basis of this high-virulence phenotype we sequenced the genome of strain mgas315 an organism isolated from a patient with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome the genome is composed of 1900521 bp and it shares approximately 17 mb of related genetic material with genomes of serotype m1 and m18 strains phage-like elements account for the great majority of variation in gene content relative to the sequenced m1 and m18 strains recombination produces chimeric phages and strains with previously uncharacterized arrays of virulence factor genes strain mgas315 has phage genes that encode proteins likely to contribute to pathogenesis such as streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin a spea and spek streptococcal superantigen ssa and a previously uncharacterized phospholipase a2 designated sla infected humans had anti-spek -ssa and -sla antibodies indicating that these gas proteins are made in vivo spek and ssa were pyrogenic and toxic for rabbits serotype m3 strains with the phage-encoded spek and sla genes increased dramatically in frequency late in the 20th century commensurate with the rise in invasive disease caused by m3 organisms taken together the results show that phage-mediated recombination has played a critical role in the emergence of a new unusually virulent clone of serotype m3 gas
B,the bacterium escherichia coli o157h7 is a worldwide threat to public health and has been implicated in many outbreaks of haemorrhagic colitis some of which included fatalities caused by haemolytic uraemic syndrome close to 75000 cases of o157h7 infection are now estimated to occur annually in the united states the severity of disease the lack of effective treatment and the potential for large-scale outbreaks from contaminated food supplies have propelled intensive research on the pathogenesis and detection of e coli o157h7 ref 4 here we have sequenced the genome of e coli o157h7 to identify candidate genes responsible for pathogenesis to develop better methods of strain detection and to advance our understanding of the evolution of e coli through comparison with the genome of the non-pathogenic laboratory strain e coli k-12 ref 5 we find that lateral gene transfer is far more extensive than previously anticipated in fact 1387 new genes encoded in strain-specific clusters of diverse sizes were found in o157h7 these include candidate virulence factors alternative metabolic capacities several prophages and other new functions--all of which could be targets for surveillance
E,atm1p a mitochondrial half-type atp-binding cassette abc protein in saccharomyces cerevisiae transports a precursor of the iron-sulfur fes cluster from mitochondria to the cytosol we have identified a novel half-type human abc protein designating it mtabc3 mammalian mitochondrial abc protein 3 mtabc3 mrna is ubiquitously expressed in all of the rat and human tissues examined mtabc3 protein is shown to be present in the mitochondria as assessed by immunoblot analysis and confocal microscopic analysis of subcellular fractions of chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing mtabc3 accumulation of iron in the mitochondria mitochondrial dna damage and respiratory dysfunction in the yeast atm1 mutant strain atm1-1 mutant cells were almost fully reversed by expressing mtabc3 in these mutant cells these results indicate that mtabc3 is a novel ortholog of the yeast and suggest an important role in mitochondrial function interestingly the human mtabc3 gene has been mapped to chromosome 2q36 a region within the candidate locus for lethal neonatal metabolic syndrome a disorder of the mitochondrial function associated with iron metabolism indicating that mtabc3 is a candidate gene for this disorder
E,we have cloned the saccharomyces cerevisiae c-4 sterol methyl oxidase erg25 gene the sterol methyl oxidase performs the first of three enzymic steps required to remove the two c-4 methyl groups leading to cholesterol animal ergosterol fungal and stigmasterol plant biosynthesis an ergosterol auxotroph erg25 which fails to demethylate and concomitantly accumulates 44-dimethylzy-mosterol was isolated after mutagenesis a complementing clone consisting of a 135-kb dra i fragment encoded a 309-amino acid polypeptide calculated molecular mass 3648 kda the amino acid sequence shows a c-terminal endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signal kkxx and three histidine-rich clusters found in eukaryotic membrane desaturases and in a bacterial alkane hydroxylase and xylene monooxygenase the sterol profile of an erg25 disruptant was consistent with the erg25 allele obtained by mutagenesis
B,the entire genome of the bacterium mycoplasma pneumoniae m129 has been sequenced it has a size of 816394 base pairs with an average gc content of 400 mol we predict 677 open reading frames orfs and 39 genes coding for various rna species of the predicted orfs 759 showed significant similarity to genesproteins of other organisms while only 99 did not reveal any significant similarity to gene sequences in databases this permitted us tentatively to assign a functional classification to a large number of orfs and to deduce the biochemical and physiological properties of this bacterium the reduction of the genome size of m pneumoniae during its reductive evolution from ancestral bacteria can be explained by the loss of complete anabolic eg no amino acid synthesis and metabolic pathways therefore m pneumoniae depends in nature on an obligate parasitic lifestyle which requires the provision of exogenous essential metabolites all the major classes of cellular processes and metabolic pathways are briefly described for a number of activitiesfunctions present in m pneumoniae according to experimental evidence the corresponding genes could not be identified by similarity search for instance we failed to identify genesproteins involved in motility chemotaxis and management of oxidative stress
E,the drosophila melanogaster gene and cdna which span the entire open reading frame for dna polymerase alpha were cloned and their nucleotide sequences were determined the gene consists of 6 exons separated by 5 short introns the major transcription initiation site was localized 85 bp upstream from the initiation codon the nucleotide sequence of the open reading frame revealed a polypeptide of 1505 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 170796 the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide was 37 homologous with that of the catalytic subunit of human dna polymerase alpha this sequence contains six regions the orders and amino acid sequences of which are highly conserved among a number of other viral and eukaryotic dna polymerases we found 7 amino acid residues in the region between the 639th and 758th positions identical to those essential for the active site of escherichia coli dna polymerase i-associated 3'----5' exonuclease thus the exonuclease activity may be associated with drosophila dna polymerase alpha levels of the dna polymerase alpha mrna were high in unfertilized eggs and early embryos relatively high in adult female flies and second-instar larva and low in bodies at other stages of development this feature of the expression is similar to that of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen an auxiliary protein of dna polymerase delta and seems to coincide with the proportions of proliferating cells in various developmental stages as the half life of the mrna for dna polymerase alpha in cultured drosophila kc cells was 15 min expression of the dna polymerase alpha gene is probably strictly regulated at the step of transcription
B,we report the complete genome sequence of the model bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato dc3000 dc3000 which is pathogenic on tomato and arabidopsis thaliana the dc3000 genome 65 megabases contains a circular chromosome and two plasmids which collectively encode 5763 orfs we identified 298 established and putative virulence genes including several clusters of genes encoding 31 confirmed and 19 predicted type iii secretion system effector proteins many of the virulence genes were members of paralogous families and also were proximal to mobile elements which collectively comprise 7 of the dc3000 genome the bacterium possesses a large repertoire of transporters for the acquisition of nutrients particularly sugars as well as genes implicated in attachment to plant surfaces over 12 of the genes are dedicated to regulation which may reflect the need for rapid adaptation to the diverse environments encountered during epiphytic growth and pathogenesis comparative analyses confirmed a high degree of similarity with two sequenced pseudomonads pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas aeruginosa yet revealed 1159 genes unique to dc3000 of which 811 lack a known function
B,pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that is one of the top three causes of opportunistic human infections a major factor in its prominence as a pathogen is its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants here we report the complete sequence of p aeruginosa strain pao1 at 63 million base pairs this is the largest bacterial genome sequenced and the sequence provides insights into the basis of the versatility and intrinsic drug resistance of p aeruginosa consistent with its larger genome size and environmental adaptability p aeruginosa contains the highest proportion of regulatory genes observed for a bacterial genome and a large number of genes involved in the catabolism transport and efflux of organic compounds as well as four potential chemotaxis systems we propose that the size and complexity of the p aeruginosa genome reflect an evolutionary adaptation permitting it to thrive in diverse environments and resist the effects of a variety of antimicrobial substances
B,the beta-galactosidase from the antarctic gram-negative bacterium pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis tae 79 was purified to homogeneity the nucleotide sequence and the nh2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme indicate that the beta-galactosidase subunit is composed of 1038 amino acids with a calculated mr of 118068 this beta-galactosidase shares structural properties with escherichia coli beta-galactosidase comparable subunit mass 51 amino sequence identity conservation of amino acid residues involved in catalysis similar optimal ph value and requirement for divalent metal ions but is characterized by a higher catalytic efficiency on synthetic and natural substrates and by a shift of apparent optimum activity toward low temperatures and lower thermal stability the enzyme also differs by a higher pi 78 and by specific thermodynamic activation parameters p haloplanktis beta-galactosidase was expressed in e coli and the recombinant enzyme displays properties identical to those of the wild-type enzyme heat-induced unfolding monitored by intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy showed lower melting point values for both p haloplanktis wild-type and recombinant beta-galactosidase compared to the mesophilic enzyme assays of lactose hydrolysis in milk demonstrate that p haloplanktis beta-galactosidase can outperform the current commercial beta-galactosidase from kluyveromyces marxianus var lactis suggesting that the cold-adapted beta-galactosidase could be used to hydrolyze lactose in dairy products processed in refrigerated plants
E,a gene scpepcd1 encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase pepc was isolated from the c-4 monocot sugarcane saccharum hybrid var h32-8560 scpepcd1 is ca 6800 bp long with 10 exons the entire gene sequence from -1561 to 262 bp downstream of the putative polya addition signal is reported a low-level essentially constitutive pattern of expression amino acid sequence similarities to other 'housekeeping' pepc enzymes and the absence of dna sequence elements conserved in the upstream region of maize and sorghum c-4-specific pepc genes indicate that scpepcd1 encodes a housekeeping pepc despite this a motif proposed to act as a phosphorylation site in light-mediated activation of photosynthetic pepc enzymes 10 is present in the scpepcd1 protein evidence is presented for the presence of this site in other housekeeping pepc proteins
E,the complete mitochondrial dna mtdna molecule of the ostrich struthio camelus was sequenced the size of the molecule is 16591 nucleotides since the ostrich represents the paleognathous birds comparison with the mtdna of the neognathous chicken the only avian species reported so far in databases made it possible to identify common and probably general avian mtdna characteristics relative to other vertebrates the avian nadh6 and trna-glu genes are positioned upstream of the control region rather than the cytochrome b gene the nadh3 gene of the ostrich is terminated by a stop codon at position 207 thus the gene is about 140 nucleotides shorter than in other vertebrates the sequence for l-strand origin of replication is missing in both birds and four transfer rna genes of the two avian mtdnas deviate from common characteristics of trnas of vertebrate mtdnas by having an adenine and not a thymidine at position 8 due to the absence of suitable fossils most paleontological datings of avian divergences are conjectural molecular dating of the divergence between the ostrich and the chicken indicates that these two avian lineages separated 80-90 mya phylogenetic analysis of complete cytochrome b genes of six avian orders showed that passeriformes represent the earliest divergence among recent birds contradicting the commonly accepted notion of a basal position of the palaeognathae among recent birds
E,a cdna encoding a recombinant eimeria acervulina antigen designated eamzp30-47 that contains an epitope shared among several surface and rhoptry proteins of merozoites was characterized the respective parasite proteins are between 30 and 47 kda as revealed by immunostaining of nitrocellulose membrane containing extracts of 125i-labeled merozoites as indicated by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopic staining the reactive epitope was localized to both the surface membrane and the internal rhoptries of this asexual stage of the parasite the recombinant beta-galactosidase fusion protein eamzp30-47 is 130 kda thus representing 15 kda or 30-50 of the respective parasite protein purified eamzp30-47 stimulates t cells from e acervulina-immune inbred chickens but is not recognized by immune chicken serum suggesting that t cell and not b cell epitopes recognized by the host immune system during a natural infection are present on the recombinant protein northern and southern blot hybridization experiments indicated that expression of eamzp30-47 is restricted to the merozoite stage of the parasite and the gene occurs as a single copy sequence within the genome
E,an intestinal elastase was purified from atlantic cod gadus morhua of apparent molecular mass 248 kda as determined by sds-page and with isoelectric point above pi 93 heat stability and stability towards acidic ph was reduced in the cod enzyme as compared with porcine intestinal elastase n-terminal amino-acid sequence analysis of cod elastase showed considerable similarity with porcine elastase the cod enzyme was less sensitive to phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride inhibition than porcine elastase but sensitivity towards other inhibitors was similar kinetic properties were examined using the substrate suc-ala-ala-ala-p-nitroanilide and the cod enzyme was found to have more than 2-times turnover rate kcat as compared with the porcine enzyme and slightly higher km values thus the catalytic efficiency kcatkm of atlantic cod elastase was about 2-times higher than observed with porcine elastase which indicates an adaptive response towards the low temperature environmental in which the cod lives substrate specificity was studied by digestion of oxidized b-chain of insulin and by using synthetic substrates digestion was most rapid at the carbonyl side of alanine residues but also occurred at valine and leucine residues
V,the entire nucleotide sequence of the ad2 ecori e fragment has been determined using the maxam and gilbert method this sequence of 2222 bp which maps between coordinate 834 and 897 contains information relative to the early 3 region and to the fiber gene altogether with fragment ecori d which has been recently sequenced they cover the entire early 3 region in which several mrna were mapped the aminoacid sequence of the 16k and 14k protein is deduced the localization of the 145k mrna directing the synthesis of the third e3 known protein is discussed as well as the hypothetical existence of three other early 3 proteins which would have a molecular weight of 11k the initiator atg triplet of the fiber protein has been found at coordinate 861 it is followed up to the end of the fragment by an open reading frame allowing deduction of 80 of the aminoacid sequence of this protein sequences known to be frequently present at the border of exon sequence were used to tentatively localize the additional z late leader
B,shewanella oneidensis is an important model organism for bioremediation studies because of its diverse respiratory capabilities conferred in part by multicomponent branched electron transport systems here we report the sequencing of the s oneidensis genome which consists of a 4969803-base pair circular chromosome with 4758 predicted protein-encoding open reading frames cds and a 161613-base pair plasmid with 173 cdss we identified the first shewanella lambda-like phage providing a potential tool for further genome engineering genome analysis revealed 39 c-type cytochromes including 32 previously unidentified in s oneidensis and a novel periplasmic fe hydrogenase which are integral members of the electron transport system this genome sequence represents a critical step in the elucidation of the pathways for reduction and bioremediation of pollutants such as uranium u and chromium cr and offers a starting point for defining this organism's complex electron transport systems and metal ion-reducing capabilities
E,amphibian skin secretions contain many biologically active compounds such as biogenic amines complex alkaloids or peptides within the latter class of molecules a large number of peptide antibiotics has been isolated and characterized from different amphibian species antimicrobial peptides are considered the effector molecules of innate immunity acting as a first line of defense against bacterial infections by perturbing the phospholipid bilayer of the target cell membrane these gene-encoded molecules are synthesized as inactive precursors and in several cases their proparts were shown to have highly conserved structures it has also been demonstrated that the promoter regions of inducible peptide antibiotics are often regulated by the transcriptional control machinery nf-kappa bi kappa b alpha in amphibia of rana and bombina genera inhibition of transcription of the genes encoding antimicrobial peptides has been obtained by glucocorticoid treatment which causes an increase of i kappa b alpha synthesis moreover determination of the structure of a number of genes coding for antimicrobial peptides in amphibia has actually shown that their promoter regions contain recognition sites for nuclear factors
E,the recently defined degenac superfamily of sodium channels includes subunits of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel enac of vertebrate colon lung kidney and tongue a molluscan fmrfamide-gated channel fanac and the nematode degenerins which are suspected mechanosensory channels we have identified two new members of this superfamily bnac1 and bnac2 in a human brain cdna library phylogenetic analysis indicates they are equally divergent from all other members of the degenac superfamily and form a new branch or family human bnac1 maps to 17q112-12 and hbnac2 maps to 12q12 northern blot and mouse brain in situ hybridizations indicate that both genes are coexpressed in most if not all brain neurons although their patterns of expression vary slightly and are expressed early in embryogenesis and throughout life by analogy to the enacs and the degenerins which form heteromultimeric channels bnac1 and bnac2 may be subunits of the same channel
E,the schizosaccharomyces pombe nuclear gene atp2 encoding the beta subunit of the mitochondrial atp synthase was sequenced and found to contain a 1575-bp open reading frame two adjacent transcription-initiation sites were found at positions 34 and 44 nucleotides upstream of the translation-initiation codon the deduced polypeptide sequence was composed of 525 amino acid residues molecular mass  56875 da the mature polypeptide starts at residue 45 molecular mass  51685 da indicating the presence of a presequence of 44 residues presumably involved in mitochondrial targeting the atp2 mutant b59-1 boutry m 38 goffeau a 1982 eur j biochem 125 471-477 and its related revertant allele r4-3 jault j m di pietro a falson p gautheron d c boutry m 38 goffeau a 1989 biochem biophys res commun 158 392-399 were also cloned and sequenced a single nonsense mutation cag gln170----tag stop in mutant b59-1 became a missense mutation tag stop----tac tyr in revertant r4-3 gln170 is located between the first and second elements belonging to the nucleotide-binding site its substitution by a tyrosine residue increases the enzyme affinity towards adp the amount of endogenous nucleotides and the apparent negative cooperativity for atpase activity
E,the cdna sequence for aphrodisin a lipocalin from hamster vaginal discharge which is involved in pheromonal activity has been determined corresponding genomic clones were isolated and the promoter region was identified primer extension analysis revealed an adenosine residue as the main transcription initiation site located 50 bp upstream of the translation start codon atg which is surrounded by a typical kozak sequence however data from polymerase chain reaction analysis suggest the existence of at least one alternative transcription initiation site the aphrodisin cdna is 732 bp long and codes for the mature 151-aa aphrodisin and an additional n-terminal 16-aa secretory signal peptide the 3' nontranslated region is 228 bp long among the known sequences the aphrodisin cdna shares the highest homology with the rat odorant-binding protein cdna 45 which verifies the protein data vaginal tissue and bartholin's glands are the main aphrodisin gene-expressing tissues of the female hamster genital tract as demonstrated by northern blot analysis under less stringent hybridization conditions rna isolated from rat bartholin's glands also showed a signal indicating the occurrence of aphrodisin-related mrna in this species
A,the complete 166-megabase pair genome sequence of an autotrophic archaeon methanococcus jannaschii and its 58- and 16-kilobase pair extrachromosomal elements have been determined by whole-genome random sequencing a total of 1738 predicted protein-coding genes were identified however only a minority of these 38 percent could be assigned a putative cellular role with high confidence although the majority of genes related to energy production cell division and metabolism in m jannaschii are most similar to those found in bacteria most of the genes involved in transcription translation and replication in m jannaschii are more similar to those found in eukaryotes
B,recombinant escherichia coli strains harboring pag1 pag2 pkbb100 and pkbb101 were cloned by using antiserum constructed against 130-kda crystal protein antigen of bacillus thuringiensis serovar japonensis strain buibui dnas in the recombinant strains hybridized to the 26-base oligonucleotide probe corresponding to n-terminal amino acids of the 130-kda crystal protein of strain buibui cultures of the recombinant strains were toxic to larvae of the cupreous chafer anomala cuprea furthermore the production of the 130-kda polypeptide was demonstrated in the cells harboring pag1 and pag2 by immunoblot analysis with antiserum against the 130-kda crystal protein southern hybridization analysis showed that the 130-kda crystal protein gene is located on the chromosomal dna of strain buibui on the other hand dna probes derived from cryiaa and cryiiia genes did not hybridize to the dna of strain buibui
E,human n-chimaerin is a gtpase-activating protein gap for p21rac and a phorbol ester receptor we have isolated rat n-chimaerin cdna and investigated the cellular and developmental pattern of mrna expression in the brain there is extensive sequence conservation with human n-chimaerin in the coding region and the first 400 nucleotides of the 3'-untranslated region utr 90 and 83 identity respectively the rat cdna encodes an additional 35 n-terminal amino acids compared with the reported human cdna which has a 5'-utr sequence inversion and a 41-nucleotide deletion including the putative initiator methionine the rat cdna encodes a 334-amino acid protein 38200 mr pi 804 with 97 amino acid sequence identity with the human protein after correction of the human 5'-dna sequence n-chimaerin mrna was detectable in embryonic rat brain at day 15 and increased in amount postnatally from birth to 20 days coincident with cellular differentiation and synaptogenesis n-chimaerin mrna is restricted to neurons with highest concentrations in hippocampal pyramidal cells granule cells of the dentate gyrus and cortical neurons in the cerebellum the mrna was detected only in purkinje neurons the pattern and specificity of mrna expression suggests an important role for n-chimaerin in neuronal signal-transduction mechanisms
B,three sets of cellulose synthase genes were cloned from a cellulose-producing bacterium acetobacter xylinum jcm 7664 one set of genes bcsaibcsbibcscibcsdi were highly conserved with the well-established type i genes in other strains of a xylinum while the other two bcsabii-a bcsabii-b were homologous to the known type ii acsaii unexpectedly they were immediately followed by a gene cluster of bcsxbcsybcsciiorf569 likely forming an operon western blotting demonstrated that the bcsy protein accumulated in cells since bcsy showed striking similarities to a number of membrane-bound transacylases it was hypothesized that the type ii cellulose synthase produces acylated cellulose which might be anchored on the cytoplasmic membrane an insertion sequence of is1380-type was found just upstream of the one type ii gene bcsabii-b suggestive of nonfunctioning
E,based on the physical map of arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 3 previously constructed with cic yac tac p1 and bac clones sato s et al dna res 5 163-168 1998 a total of 60 p1 and tac clones were sequenced and the sequence features of the resulting 4504864 bp regions were analyzed by applying various computer programs for similarity search and gene modeling as a result a total of 1054 potential protein-coding genes were identified the average density of the genes identified was 1 gene per 4066 bp introns were observed in 77 of the genes and the average number per gene and the average length of the introns were 39 and 156 bp respectively these sequence features are essentially identical to those of chromosome 5 in our previous reports but the gene density was slightly higher than that observed for chromosomes 2 and 4 the regions also contained 10 trna genes when searched by similarity to reported trna genes and the trna scan-se program the sequence data and information on the potential genes are available through the world wide web database kaos kazusa arabidopsis data opening site at httpwwwkazusaorjpkaos
E,a human cdna library obtained from cultured normal mammary epithelial cells hmecs was searched by subtractive hybridization for genes whose decrease in expression might be relevant to epithelial transformation one clone identified by this procedure corresponded to a 14-kilobase mrna designated nb-1 whose expression was decreased greater than 50-fold in hmecs tumorigenically transformed in vitro after exposure to benzoapyrene and kirsten sarcoma virus sequence analysis of nb-1 cdna revealed an open reading frame with a high degree of homology to calmodulin nb-1 expression could be demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction amplification in normal breast prostate cervix and epidermal tissues the presence of nb-1 transcripts was variable in primary breast carcinoma tissues and undetectable in tumor-derived cell lines of breast prostate or other origins nb-1 mrna expression could be down-regulated in cultured hmecs by exposure to reconstituted extracellular matrix material while exposure to transforming growth factor type beta increased its relative abundance the protein encoded by nb-1 may have ca2 binding properties and perform functions similar to those of authentic calmodulin its possible roles in differentiation andor suppression of tumorigenicity in epithelial tissues remain to be examined
V,bacteriophage t4 gene 44 protein is a dna polymerase accessory protein which is required for t4 dna replication we have isolated the gene for 44 protein from a previously constructed lambda-t4 hybrid phage wilson g g tanyashin v i and murray n e 1977 mol gen genet 156 203-214 we report here the nucleotide sequence of gene 44 and about 60 nucleotides 5' upstream from its coding region which is immediately adjacent to gene 45 we have also purified 44 protein from t4-infected cells and submitted it to extensive protein chemistry characterization thus considerable portions of the protein sequence predicted from the dna sequence were confirmed by direct protein sequencing of peptides or by matching amino acid compositions of purified peptides a total of 84 of the predicted amino acids was confirmed by the protein data these studies indicate that gene 44 codes for a polypeptide containing 319 amino acids with a calculated mr  35371 the coding region of gene 44 is preceded by a potential regulatory region containing sequences homologous to the escherichia coli -10 rna polymerase binding region and to a conserved sequence at -25 to -30 found in other t4 middle genes in addition there are sequence similarities in the translation initiation regions of genes 44 45 and riib all of which are subject to regulation by rega protein
E,two cdna clones 2c19 and 4c1 were isolated from a lung cdna library of 3-methylcholanthrene mc-treated hamster by using rat p-450c cdna as a probe the cdna determined from 2c19 and 4c1 was 2916 bp long and contained an entire coding region for 524 amino acids with a molecular weight of 59408 the deduced amino acid sequence showed a 85 identity with that of rat p-450c indicating 2c19 and 4c1 encode the hamster p-450ia1 protein another cdna clone designated h28 was isolated from a mc-induced hamster liver cdna library by using the hamster lung 2c19 or 4c1 cdna clone as a probe h28 was 1876 bp long and encoded a polypeptide of 513 amino acids with a molecular weight of 58079 the n-terminal 20 residues deduced from nucleotide sequence of h28 were identical to those determined by sequence analysis of purified hamster hepatic p-450mci the high similarity of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences between h28 and p-450ia2 of other species indicated that h28 encoded a p-450 protein which belongs to the p-450ia2 family northern blot analysis revealed that the mrnas for hamster p-450ia1 and ia2 were about 29 and 19 kb long respectively hamster p-450ia1 mrna was induced to the same level in lungs as in livers by mc treatment whereas hamster p-450ia2 mrna was induced and expressed only in hamster liver
B,we present a complete dna sequence and metabolic analysis of the dominant oral bacterium fusobacterium nucleatum although not considered a major dental pathogen on its own this anaerobe facilitates the aggregation and establishment of several other species including the dental pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus the f nucleatum strain atcc 25586 genome was assembled from shotgun sequences and analyzed using the ergo bioinformatics suite httpwwwintegratedgenomicscom the genome contains 217 mb encoding 2067 open reading frames organized on a single circular chromosome with 27 gc content despite its taxonomic position among the gram-negative bacteria several features of its core metabolism are similar to that of gram-positive clostridium spp enterococcus spp and lactococcus spp the genome analysis has revealed several key aspects of the pathways of organic acid amino acid carbohydrate and lipid metabolism nine very-high-molecular-weight outer membrane proteins are predicted from the sequence none of which has been reported in the literature more than 137 transporters for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as peptides sugars metal ions and cofactors have been identified biosynthetic pathways exist for only three amino acids glutamate aspartate and asparagine the remaining amino acids are imported as such or as di- or oligopeptides that are subsequently degraded in the cytoplasm a principal source of energy appears to be the fermentation of glutamate to butyrate additionally desulfuration of cysteine and methionine yields ammonia h2s methyl mercaptan and butyrate which are capable of arresting fibroblast growth thus preventing wound healing and aiding penetration of the gingival epithelium the metabolic capabilities of f nucleatum revealed by its genome are therefore consistent with its specialized niche in the mouth
B,we describe here the complete genome sequence 1111523 base pairs of the obligate intracellular parasite rickettsia prowazekii the causative agent of epidemic typhus this genome contains 834 protein-coding genes the functional profiles of these genes show similarities to those of mitochondrial genes no genes required for anaerobic glycolysis are found in either r prowazekii or mitochondrial genomes but a complete set of genes encoding components of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the respiratory-chain complex is found in r prowazekii in effect atp production in rickettsia is the same as that in mitochondria many genes involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of biosynthesis of amino acids and nucleosides in free-living bacteria are absent from r prowazekii and mitochondria such genes seem to have been replaced by homologues in the nuclear host genome the r prowazekii genome contains the highest proportion of non-coding dna 24 detected so far in a microbial genome such non-coding sequences may be degraded remnants of 'neutralized' genes that await elimination from the genome phylogenetic analyses indicate that r prowazekii is more closely related to mitochondria than is any other microbe studied so far
B,the genus xanthomonas is a diverse and economically important group of bacterial phytopathogens belonging to the gamma-subdivision of the proteobacteria xanthomonas axonopodis pv citri xac causes citrus canker which affects most commercial citrus cultivars resulting in significant losses worldwide symptoms include canker lesions leading to abscission of fruit and leaves and general tree decline xanthomonas campestris pv campestris xcc causes black rot which affects crucifers such as brassica and arabidopsis symptoms include marginal leaf chlorosis and darkening of vascular tissue accompanied by extensive wilting and necrosis xanthomonas campestris pv campestris is grown commercially to produce the exopolysaccharide xanthan gum which is used as a viscosifying and stabilizing agent in many industries here we report and compare the complete genome sequences of xac and xcc their distinct disease phenotypes and host ranges belie a high degree of similarity at the genomic level more than 80 of genes are shared and gene order is conserved along most of their respective chromosomes we identified several groups of strain-specific genes and on the basis of these groups we propose mechanisms that may explain the differing host specificities and pathogenic processes
B,countless millions of people have died from tuberculosis a chronic infectious disease caused by the tubercle bacillus the complete genome sequence of the best-characterized strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv has been determined and analysed in order to improve our understanding of the biology of this slow-growing pathogen and to help the conception of new prophylactic and therapeutic interventions the genome comprises 4411529 base pairs contains around 4000 genes and has a very high guanine  cytosine content that is reflected in the blased amino-acid content of the proteins m tuberculosis differs radically from other bacteria in that a very large portion of its coding capacity is devoted to the production of enzymes involved in lipogenesis and lipolysis and to two new families of glycine-rich proteins with a repetitive structure that may represent a source of antigenic variation
B,pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that is one of the top three causes of opportunistic human infections a major factor in its prominence as a pathogen is its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants here we report the complete sequence of p aeruginosa strain pao1 at 63 million base pairs this is the largest bacterial genome sequenced and the sequence provides insights into the basis of the versatility and intrinsic drug resistance of p aeruginosa consistent with its larger genome size and environmental adaptability p aeruginosa contains the highest proportion of regulatory genes observed for a bacterial genome and a large number of genes involved in the catabolism transport and efflux of organic compounds as well as four potential chemotaxis systems we propose that the size and complexity of the p aeruginosa genome reflect an evolutionary adaptation permitting it to thrive in diverse environments and resist the effects of a variety of antimicrobial substances
E,a cdna of trichoderma harzianum chit42 coding for an endochitinase of 42 kda has been cloned using synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to amino-acid sequences of the purified chitinase the cdna codes for a protein of 423 amino acids analysis of the n-terminal amino-acid sequence of the chitinase and comparison with that deduced from the nucleotide sequence revealed post-translational processing of a putative signal peptide of 22 amino acids and a second peptide of 12 amino acids the chit42 sequence presents overall similarities with filamentous fungal and bacterial chitinases and to a lesser extent with yeast and plant chitinases the deduced amino-acid sequence has putative catalytic phosphorylation and glycosylation domains expression of chit42 mrna is strongly induced by chitin and chitin-containing cell walls and is subjected to catabolite repression southern analysis shows that it is present as a single-copy gene in t harzianum chit42 is also detected in several tested mycoparasitic and non-mycoparasitic fungal strains
E,in saccharomyces cerevisiae the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme a may proceed directly via the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex pdh or indirectly via the so-called pdh bypass which requires the sequential action of pyruvate decarboxylase acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and acetyl-coenzyme a synthetase the relative contribution of both pathways to the rate of acetyl-coenzyme a synthesis varies in an unknown way with cultural conditions to determine the possible role of acetyl-coenzyme a synthetase in this central part of metabolism we have analyzed the genes encoding this enzyme disruption of the recently cloned acs1 gene de virgilio c burckert n barth g neuhaus j boller t 38 wiemken a 1992 yeast 8 1043-1051 did not cause an apparent phenotype except for a prolonged lag-phase during growth on glucose or c2 compounds such as acetate and ethanol in fact a product from a different gene is responsible for acetyl-coenzyme a formation in the acs1 mutant we cloned a second gene encoding acetyl-coenzyme a synthetase which we called acs2 inactivation of this gene caused inability to grow on media containing glucose but not on media with acetate or ethanol as the sole carbon source this indicates that acs2 is essential for growth on glucose in batch cultures the acs1-acs2 double mutant was not viable the role of both genes in glucose metabolism and acetate or ethanol metabolism is discussed
E,our genetic analysis indicates that the unc-101 gene of caenorhabditis elegans is required for many aspects of development and behavior including negative regulation of vulval differentiation we have cloned unc-101 and found that it encodes a homolog of the mammalian medium chains of clathrin-associated protein complexes located at the trans-golgi and the plasma membrane ap47 and ap50 respectively therefore clathrin-mediated events might contribute to the negative regulation of vulval differentiation comparison of sequences including a full-length sequence of a c elegans ap50 homolog reveals that unc-101 is most closely related to ap47 mouse ap47 and nematode unc-101 proteins are functionally equivalent as assayed in transgenic nematodes we have sequenced the mutant alleles of unc-101 identified in various genetic screens and shown that all but one are deletions or nonsense mutations suggesting that these alleles severely reduce unc-101 function
E,molecular systematists need increased access to nuclear genes highly conserved low copy number protein-encoding nuclear genes have attractive features for phylogenetic inference but have heretofore been applied mostly to very ancient divergences by virtue of their synonymous substitutions such genes should contain a wealth of information about lower-level taxonomic relationships as well with the advantage that amino acid conservatism makes both alignment and primer definition straightforward we tested this postulate for the elongation factor-1 alpha ef-1 alpha gene in the noctuid moth subfamily heliothinae which has probably diversified since the middle tertiary we sequenced 1240 bp in 18 taxa representing heliothine groupings strongly supported by previous morphological and allozyme studies the single most parsimonious gene tree and the neighbor-joining tree for all nucleotides show almost complete concordance with the morphological tree homoplasy and pairwise divergence levels are low transitiontransversion ratios are high and phylogenetic information is spread evenly across gene regions the ef-1 alpha gene and presumably other highly conserved genes hold much promise for phylogenetics of tertiary age eukaryote groups
E,the complete primary structure of bovine heart cytochrome c1 was established by analyses of peptide fragments prepared by digestion using trypsin staphylococcal protease and chymotrypsin and by cyanogen bromide cleavage of cytochrome c1 and its derivatives the total number of amino acid residues is 241 giving a molecular weight of 27924 including the heme group the nh2- and cooh-terminal residues are serine and lysine respectively one characteristic of the protein is that cytochrome c1 contains 436 hydrophobic residues and the polarity is estimated to be 411 no clear homology was found between cytochrome c1 and other membranous proteins such as cytochrome b5 or the subunits of cytochrome oxidase for which sequences have been reported cytochrome c1 is predicted to have a high content of alpha-helix 46 partial sequence studies were also carried out on cytochrome c1 preparations obtained by different procedures and showed that there is no difference among the sequences of various preparations of cytochrome c1 the presence of a hydrophobic cluster near the cooh-terminal region indicates that the cooh-terminal region of cytochrome c1 associates with or is buried in the phospholipid bilayer of the mitochondrial membrane
E,trypanosoma cruzi is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite the parasite mammalian stage surface antigens exhibit extensive antigenic diversity we have characterized a family of t cruzi genes that code for a polymorphic set of 85-kd surface antigens the sa85-1 antigens the family contains greater than 100 genes and pseudogenes of which a minimum of nine are transcribed the gene family is expressed in the mammalian stage only a subset of the gene family is present in two telomere-linked copies in the genome telomere linkage of other expressed sa85-1 genes has not been demonstrated we have shown that at least three members of the sa85-1 gene family encode antigens at the surface of the mammalian stage of the parasite interestingly these three antigens are expressed on all the trypanosomes examined this suggests that t cruzi simultaneously expresses a large repertoire of similar but diverse antigens at its surface thus t cruzi exhibits extensive antigenic diversity in a system unique from that of african trypanosomes perhaps reflecting its intracellular niche
B,salmonella typhimurium synthesizes cobalamin vitamin b12 de novo under anaerobic conditions of the 30 cobalamin synthetic genes 25 are clustered in one operon cob and are arranged in three groups each group encoding enzymes for a biochemically distinct portion of the biosynthetic pathway we have determined the dna sequence for the promoter region and the proximal 171 kb of the cob operon this sequence includes 20 translationally coupled genes that encode the enzymes involved in parts i and iii of the cobalamin biosynthetic pathway a comparison of these genes with the cobalamin synthetic genes from pseudomonas denitrificans allows assignment of likely functions to 12 of the 20 sequenced salmonella genes three additional salmonella genes encode proteins likely to be involved in the transport of cobalt a component of vitamin b12 however not all salmonella and pseudomonas cobalamin synthetic genes have apparent homologs in the other species these differences suggest that the cobalamin biosynthetic pathways differ between the two organisms the evolution of these genes and their chromosomal positions is discussed
B,the 3308274-bp sequence of the chromosome of lactobacillus plantarum strain wcfs1 a single colony isolate of strain ncimb8826 that was originally isolated from human saliva has been determined and contains 3052 predicted protein-encoding genes putative biological functions could be assigned to 2120 70 of the predicted proteins consistent with the classification of l plantarum as a facultative heterofermentative lactic acid bacterium the genome encodes all enzymes required for the glycolysis and phosphoketolase pathways all of which appear to belong to the class of potentially highly expressed genes in this organism as was evident from the codon-adaptation index of individual genes moreover l plantarum encodes a large pyruvate-dissipating potential leading to various end-products of fermentation l plantarum is a species that is encountered in many different environmental niches and this flexible and adaptive behavior is reflected by the relatively large number of regulatory and transport functions including 25 complete pts sugar transport systems moreover the chromosome encodes 200 extracellular proteins many of which are predicted to be bound to the cell envelope a large proportion of the genes encoding sugar transport and utilization as well as genes encoding extracellular functions appear to be clustered in a 600-kb region near the origin of replication many of these genes display deviation of nucleotide composition consistent with a foreign origin these findings suggest that these genes which provide an important part of the interaction of l plantarum with its environment form a lifestyle adaptation region in the chromosome
B,the hemoprotein component of salmonella typhimurium sulfite reductase nadph ec 1812 was purified to homogeneity from cysj266 a mutant strain lacking sulfite reductase flavoprotein the siroheme- and fe4s4-containing enzyme was isolated as a monomeric 63-kda polypeptide and consisted of a mixture of unligated enzyme and a complex with sulfite following reduction with 5'-deazaflavin-edta and reoxidation the complex was converted to the uncomplexed high spin ferri-siroheme state seen previously with escherichia coli sulfite reductase hemoprotein preparations the s typhimurium hemoprotein exhibited catalytic and physical properties identical to the hemoprotein prepared by urea dissociation of e coli sulfite reductase holoenzyme and was fully competent in reconstituting nadph-sulfite reductase activity when combined with excess purified sulfite reductase flavoprotein the dna sequences of cysi and cysh from s typhimurium and e coli b were determined and together with previously reported data confirmed the organization of this region as promoter-cysj-cysi-cysh with all three genes oriented in the same direction from the promoter molecular weights deduced for the cysi-encoded sulfite reductase hemoprotein and for the cysh-encoded 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate sulfotransferase were approximately 64000 and 28000 respectively comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of sulfite reductase hemoprotein with that of spinach nitrite reductase back e burkhart w moyer m privalle l and rothstein s 1988 mol gen genet 212 20-26 which also contains siroheme and an fe4s4 cluster showed two groups of cysteine-containing sequences with the structures cys-x3-cys and cys-x5-cys which are homologous in the two enzymes and are postulated to provide the ligands of the fe4s4 cluster in both proteins from these sequences and from crystallographic mcree d e richardson d c richardson j s and siegel l m 1986 j biol chem 261 10277-10281 and spectroscopic data in the literature a model is proposed for the structure of the active center of these two enzymes
E,the plant arabidopsis thaliana arabidopsis has become an important model species for the study of many aspects of plant biology the relatively small size of the nuclear genome and the availability of extensive physical maps of the five chromosomes provide a feasible basis for initiating sequencing of the five chromosomes the yac yeast artificial chromosome-based physical map of chromosome 4 was used to construct a sequence-ready map of cosmid and bac bacterial artificial chromosome clones covering a 19-megabase mb contiguous region and the sequence of this region is reported here analysis of the sequence revealed an average gene density of one gene every 48 kilobases kb and 54 of the predicted genes had significant similarity to known genes other interesting features were found such as the sequence of a disease-resistance gene locus the distribution of retroelements the frequent occurrence of clustered gene families and the sequence of several classes of genes not previously encountered in plants
B,rickettsia conorii is an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes mediterranean spotted fever in humans we determined the 1268755-nucleotide complete genome sequence of r conorii containing 1374 open reading frames this genome exhibits 804 of the 834 genes of the previously determined r prowazekii genome plus 552 supplementary open reading frames and a 10-fold increase in the number of repetitive elements despite these differences the two genomes exhibit a nearly perfect colinearity that allowed the clear identification of different stages of gene alterations with gene remnants and 37 genes split in 105 fragments of which 59 are transcribed a 38-kilobase sequence inversion was dated shortly after the divergence of the genus
E,members of the chenopodiaceae such as sugar beet and spinach accumulate glycine betaine in response to salinity or drought stress the last enzyme in the glycine betaine biosynthetic pathway is betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase badh in sugar beet the activity of badh was found to increase two- to four-fold in both leaves and roots as the nacl level in the irrigation solution was raised from 0 to 500 mm this increase in badh activity was paralleled by an increase in level of translatable badh mrna several cdnas encoding badh were cloned from a lambda gt10 library representing polya rna from salinized leaves of sugar beet plants by hybridization with a spinach badh cdna three nearly full-length cdna clones were confirmed to encode badh by their nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence identity to spinach badh these clones showed minor nucleotide sequence differences consistent with their being of two different badh alleles the clones averaged 17 kb and contained an open reading frame predicting a polypeptide of 500 amino acids with 83 identity to spinach badh rna gel blot analysis of total rna showed that salinization to 500 mm nacl increased badh mrna levels four-fold in leaves and three-fold in the taproot dna gel blot analyses indicated the presence of at least two copies of badh in the haploid sugar beet genome
E,the anaphase-promoting complex apc is a multi-subunit e3 protein ubiquitin ligase that is responsible for the metaphase to anaphase transition and the exit from mitosis one of the subunits of the apc that is required for its ubiquitination activity is doc1apc10 a protein composed of a doc1 homology domain that has been identified in a number of diverse putative e3 ubiquitin ligases here we present the crystal structure of saccharomyces cerevisiae doc1apc10 at 22a resolution the doc1 homology domain forms a beta-sandwich structure that is related in architecture to the galactose-binding domain of galactose oxidase the coagulation factor c2 domain and a domain of xrcc1 residues that are invariant amongst doc1apc10 sequences including a temperature-sensitive mitotic arrest mutant map to a beta-sheet region of the molecule whose counterpart in galactose oxidase the coagulation factor c2 domains and xrcc1 mediate bio-molecular interactions this finding suggests the identification of the functionally important and conserved region of doc1apc10 and since invariant residues of doc1apc10 colocalise with conserved residues of other doc1 homology domains we propose that the doc1 homology domains perform common ubiquitination functions in the apc and other e3 ubiquitin ligases
E,the pig and human dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase dpd cdnas were cloned and sequenced the pig enzyme expressed in escherichia coli catalyzed the reduction of uracil thymine and 5-fluorouracil with kinetics approximating those published for the enzyme purified from mammalian liver dpd could be expressed in significant quantities only when uracil was added to the bacterial growth medium the pig and human enzymes contained 1025 amino acids and calculated mr  111416 and 111398 respectively conserved domains corresponding to a possible nadph binding site and fad binding site were found in the nh2-terminal half of the proteins and two motifs of putative 4fe-4s binding sites were found near to the carboxyl terminus of the enzyme the latter corresponds to the labile cooh-terminal fragment previously shown to contain the iron sulfur centers a sequence encompassing a peptide corresponding to the uracil binding site was found between the nadphfad-containing nh2-terminal portion of the protein and the iron-sulfur binding sites near to the cooh terminus thus the dpd appears to be derived from at least three distinct domains the dpyd gene was localized to the centromeric region of human chromosome 1 between 1p22 and q21
E,the amino acid sequence of polypeptide ii from beef heart cytochrome c oxidase is described comparision of this primary structure with those of azurins plastocyanins and stellacyanins reveals clear homologies among them thus subunit ii of the oxidase is a member of this copper protein family the sequence homology indicates a copper binding site consisting of two invariant histidines and two sulfur-containing amino acids thus subunit ii is like a blue copper protein with type i copper
E,a full-length cdna coding for mouse lysosomal acid beta-galactosidase has been isolated on the basis of homology with the human gene catalytic activity toward 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-d-galactoside in the cos-1 cell expression system provided positive proof for its authenticity the sequence analysis showed that the degree of similarity between the human and mouse enzymes was approximately 70 in the nucleotide sequence and nearly 80 in the amino acid sequence the deduced primary amino acid sequences of the enzymes from the two species indicated that of the seven possible n-glycosylation sites in the human enzyme five are conserved in the mouse enzyme three additional possible n-glycosylation sites not present in the human enzyme are found in the primary amino acid sequence of the mouse enzyme all seven cysteine residues in the mouse enzyme are conserved in the human enzyme although the nucleotide sequence could be aligned to 60 identity with the e coli beta-galactosidase similarity in the amino acid sequence was minimal
V,in all herpesviruses a block of genes is present which is composed of the genes encoding dna polymerase glycoprotein b gb icp185 and major dna-binding protein mdbp here we report the cloning and sequencing of this gene block from rat cytomegalovirus rcmv the gene block spans 133 kbp and contains the four genes in the order pol gb icp185 and mdbp a similar order of genes has previously been reported for human and murine cytomegaloviruses the pol gb icp185 and mdbp genes contain open reading frames which have the capacity to encode proteins of 1120 914 893 and 1281 amino acids respectively comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of the four rcmv proteins with the corresponding proteins of other herpesviruses revealed a close relationship between rcmv and other cytomegaloviruses which corroborates the usefulness of the rcmv-rat model for studying cytomegalovirus biology
B,the nucleotide sequence of the entire genome of a filamentous cyanobacterium anabaena sp strain pcc 7120 was determined the genome of anabaena consisted of a single chromosome 6413771 bp and six plasmids designated pcc7120alpha 408101 bp pcc7120beta 186614 bp pcc7120gamma 101965 bp pcc7120delta 55414 bp pcc7120epsilon 40340 bp and pcc7120zeta 5584 bp the chromosome bears 5368 potential protein-encoding genes four sets of rrna genes 48 trna genes representing 42 trna species and 4 genes for small structural rnas the predicted products of 45 of the potential protein-encoding genes showed sequence similarity to known and predicted proteins of known function and 27 to translated products of hypothetical genes the remaining 28 lacked significant similarity to genes for known and predicted proteins in the public dna databases more than 60 genes involved in various processes of heterocyst formation and nitrogen fixation were assigned to the chromosome based on their similarity to the reported genes one hundred and ninety-five genes coding for components of two-component signal transduction systems nearly 25 times as many as those in synechocystis sp pcc 6803 were identified on the chromosome only 37 of the anabaena genes showed significant sequence similarity to those of synechocystis indicating a high degree of divergence of the gene information between the two cyanobacterial strains
E,a 328-bp sequence from exon 1 of the gene for aquaporin-2 aqp2 was compared in 12 mammalian species representing as many eutherian orders this sequence encodes the n-terminal half of this kidney-specific water channel protein most amino acid replacements as well as an insertion have occurred in extracellular loops connecting the transmembrane helices in agreement with a lower functional importance of these loops phylogenetic analyses were performed with parsimony distance and maximum-likelihood methods the aqp2 data set alone as well as in combination with previously published alpha a-crystallin protein sequences strongly supports a clade consisting of elephant hyrax aardvark and elephant shrew reaching bootstrap values of 99 this finding fully agrees with the only other presently available sequence data sets that include these taxa those of von willebrand factor and interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein and suggests that this extended paenungulate clade is one of the most conspicuous superordinal groupings in eutherian phylogeny some support was obtained for an artiodactylperissodactyl clade while the grouping of pholidotes with edentates was contradicted
E,several allozyme-coding genes in drosophila melanogaster show patterns suggesting that polymorphisms at these loci are targets of balancing selection an important question is whether these genes have similar distributions of underlying dna sequence variation which would indicate similar evolutionary processes occurring in this class of loci one such locus 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase pgd has previously been shown to exhibit clinal variation for fastslow electromorph variation in the united states and australia unusually large electromorph frequency differences between the united states and africa and other patterns indicative of selection we measured four-cutter dna restriction site and allozyme variation at pgd among 142 d melanogaster x chromosomes collected from several geographic regions including north carolina california and zimbabwe africa we also sequenced a representative sample of 13 d melanogaster pgd genes collected in north carolina and a single copy of pgd from the sibling species drosophila simulans while some population genetic models predict excess dna polymorphism in genes which are targets of balancing selection the d melanogaster samples from the united states had significantly reduced levels of dna polymorphism and extraordinarily high levels of linkage disequilibrium providing evidence of hitchhiking effects of advantageous mutants at pgd or at linked sites therefore while selection has probably influenced the distribution of dna variation at pgd the precise nature of these selective events remains obscure since the pgd region appears to have low rates of crossing over the reduced level of variation at this locus supports the idea that recombination rates are important determinants of levels of dna polymorphism in natural populations furthermore while patterns of allozyme variation are very similar at pgd and adh the dna data show that the evolutionary histories of these genes are dramatically different we observed extensive differences in the amount and distribution of variation in d melanogaster pgd samples from the united states and zimbabwe which cannot be explained by differential selection on the fastslow polymorphism in these two geographic regions thus genetic drift among partially isolated populations has also been an important factor in determining the distribution of variation at pgd in d melanogaster finally we assayed four-cutter variation at pgd in a sample of 19 d simulans x chromosomes and observed reduced levels of dna variability and high levels of linkage disequilibrium these patterns are consistent with predictions of some hitchhiking models
B,the marine unicellular cyanobacterium prochlorococcus is the smallest-known oxygen-evolving autotroph it numerically dominates the phytoplankton in the tropical and subtropical oceans and is responsible for a significant fraction of global photosynthesis here we compare the genomes of two prochlorococcus strains that span the largest evolutionary distance within the prochlorococcus lineage and that have different minimum maximum and optimal light intensities for growth the high-light-adapted ecotype has the smallest genome 1657990 base pairs 1716 genes of any known oxygenic phototroph whereas the genome of its low-light-adapted counterpart is significantly larger at 2410873 base pairs 2275 genes the comparative architectures of these two strains reveal dynamic genomes that are constantly changing in response to myriad selection pressures although the two strains have 1350 genes in common a significant number are not shared and these have been differentially retained from the common ancestor or acquired through duplication or lateral transfer some of these genes have obvious roles in determining the relative fitness of the ecotypes in response to key environmental variables and hence in regulating their distribution and abundance in the oceans
E,the ard gene encodes a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor achr protein from drosophila ard protein cytogenetically this gene maps at position 64bc on the left arm of the 3rd chromosome five introns interrupt the protein coding region of the gene and one is found upstream of the translation start site the ard gene thus contains less introns than vertebrate muscle achr genes but with one exception the positions of the resident introns are precisely conserved implications for the evolution of achr genes are discussed
E,only a small proportion of the mouse genome is transcribed into mature messenger rna transcripts there is an international collaborative effort to identify all full-length mrna transcripts from the mouse and to ensure that each is represented in a physical collection of clones here we report the manual annotation of 60770 full-length mouse complementary dna sequences these are clustered into 33409 'transcriptional units' contributing 901 of a newly established mouse transcriptome database of these transcriptional units 4258 are new protein-coding and 11665 are new non-coding messages indicating that non-coding rna is a major component of the transcriptome 41 of all transcriptional units showed evidence of alternative splicing in protein-coding transcripts 79 of splice variations altered the protein product whole-transcriptome analyses resulted in the identification of 2431 sense-antisense pairs the present work completely supported by physical clones provides the most comprehensive survey of a mammalian transcriptome so far and is a valuable resource for functional genomics
E,cdnas encoding the human homolog of bag1 a bcl-2-binding protein with anti-apoptotic function were cloned dna sequence analysis of human bag1 cdnas predicts a protein with an additional 55 amino acids at its nh2-terminus compared to the mouse protein immunoblot assays using monoclonal antibodies raised against bacterially produced h-bag1 protein confirmed the larger size of the human protein approximately 34 kda compared to mouse pcr analysis of dna from human x rodent somatic cell hybrids using human bag1-specific primers localized the gene to human chromosome 9 cosmid clones of h-bag1 were obtained and used for fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of normal metaphase chromosomes thus localizing h-bag1 to 9p12 a region associated with hereditary disorders that may involve developmental dysregulation of programmed cell death
E,we have previously shown that the mitochondrial gene atpa encoding the alpha subunit of f1 atp synthase is associated with dna rearrangements and nuclear-specific transcript patterns in the male-sterile cytoplasm of ogura radish here we present a detailed characterization of this gene from both the normal fertile and ogura male-sterile cytoplasms of radish to determine if it is involved in ogura cytoplasmic male sterility the normal and ogura radish atpa loci are virtually identical for 38 kb including a 507 codon open reading frame whose product is approximately 92 identical to other plant atpa polypeptides rearrangement breakpoints have been identified 613 bp 5' and 1663 bp 3' to the atpa coding region the 5' rearrangement breakpoint is located within a repeated sequence that has been associated with other rearrangement events in radish mitochondria the previously identified transcript difference results from transcription originating upstream of this rearrangement site although the presence of this transcript is affected by nuclear background analyses in several different sterile and fertile nuclear backgrounds indicate that the presence of this transcript is not strictly correlated with male sterility in addition normal levels of atpa polypeptide are present in sterile plants containing the ogura cytoplasm
E,we report the isolation and sequence of genomic clones encoding a chaperonin 60 gene from the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum the gene contains a single intron of 868 nucleotides the largest yet identified in this organism the reading frame encodes a product with a predicted length of 719 amino acid residues 816 kda which is considerably longer than any chaperonin 60 protein sequenced to date revealing good identity with other chaperonin 60 proteins there is a putative mitochondrial signal peptide and an usually long carboxy terminus composed almost entirely of glutamic and aspartic acid residues the gene was located on chromosome 12 and a 4-kb transcript was identified
B,the human gut is colonized with a vast community of indigenous microorganisms that help shape our biology here we present the complete genome sequence of the gram-negative anaerobe bacteroides thetaiotaomicron a dominant member of our normal distal intestinal microbiota its 4779-member proteome includes an elaborate apparatus for acquiring and hydrolyzing otherwise indigestible dietary polysaccharides and an associated environment-sensing system consisting of a large repertoire of extracytoplasmic function sigma factors and one- and two-component signal transduction systems these and other expanded paralogous groups shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying symbiotic host-bacterial relationships in our intestine
B,leptospirosis is a widely spread disease of global concern infection causes flu-like episodes with frequent severe renal and hepatic damage such as haemorrhage and jaundice in more severe cases massive pulmonary haemorrhages including fatal sudden haemoptysis can occur here we report the complete genomic sequence of a representative virulent serovar type strain lai of leptospira interrogans serogroup icterohaemorrhagiae consisting of a 433-megabase large chromosome and a 359-kilobase small chromosome with a total of 4768 predicted genes in terms of the genetic determinants of physiological characteristics the facultatively parasitic l interrogans differs extensively from two other strictly parasitic pathogenic spirochaetes treponema pallidum and borrelia burgdorferi although similarities exist in the genes that govern their unique morphological features a comprehensive analysis of the l interrogans genes for chemotaxismotility and lipopolysaccharide synthesis provides a basis for in-depth studies of virulence and pathogenesis the discovery of a series of genes possibly related to adhesion invasion and the haematological changes that characterize leptospirosis has provided clues about how an environmental organism might evolve into an important human pathogen
E,sry sex-determining region of the y chromosome has recently been identified as a key regulatory gene in mammalian sex determination the open reading frame of this gene contains an 80-amino-acid motif the sry-box which shares a high degree of homology with a dna-binding domain found in the high-mobility-group hmg proteins hmg1 and hmg2 the sry box motif is highly conserved in several sequence-specific dna-binding proteins that are known to act as transcription factors here we describe the use of degenerate pcr primers to identify sry-related sequences containing the sry-box motif from the genomic dna of a variety of species the results of this study suggest that in a diverse array of species sry-related genes may serve as transcription factors that regulate a variety of developmental pathways including sex determination
E,we have cloned a cdna encoding beta 1-4n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase ec 24192 galnac-t from rat ascites hepatoma of the free-cell type ah7974f the cell line only expressed asialo-series glycosphingolipids gsls including asialo-gm2 taki t hirabayashi y ishiwata y matsumoto m and kojima k 1979 biochim biophys acta 572 113-120 the cdna pgna56 was isolated by screening ah7974f cdna library in lambda gt10 with a probe the probe was obtained from ah7974f cdna by pcr using primers with the nucleotide sequence of the human galnac-t cdna the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of pgna56 exhibited 88 similarity to the human galnac-t sequence the enzyme was a typical type ii membrane protein which consisted of a short n-terminal residue a transmembrane region and a long c-terminal residue including the catalytic domain the substrate specificity of rat galnac-t was determined using homogenates from cells into which the cdna clone was transfected the enzyme catalysed not only the formation of gm2 and gd2 from gm3 and gd3 respectively but also asialo-gm2 from cdh it also acted on gsl substrates including gm1b sialylparagloboside and gd1 alpha on the other hand the enzyme did not transfer galnac to soluble substrates such as glycoproteins and oligosaccharide the gsl compositional and immunocytochemical analyses of stable transfectants obtained by transfection of the cdna showed simultaneous expression of asialo-gm2 and gm2 on the plasma membrane therefore we concluded that the formation of asialo-gm2 gm2 and gd2 was catalysed by the single galnac-t northern-blot hybridization showed that the galnac-t mrna was strongly expressed in rat brain testis and spleen the gene was also expressed in rat normal liver to a lesser extent we found the gsls in asialo- and alpha-pathways such as asialo-gm1 and gd1 alpha in the rat tissues by using a sensitive tlc-immunostaining method these observations also supported our conclusion that the single galnac-t synthesizes asialo-gm2 gm2 and gd2 in vivo
E,structural differences in dihydrofolate reductases from different species have been exploited to develop specific inhibitory molecules such as chemotherapeutic agents antibiotics or antihelminthics that show species specificity or selectivity as dihydrofolate reductase dhfr is a crucial enzyme for the synthesis of purines pyrimidines and some amino acids and also because developing insects show a remarkably rapid rate of cell division dhfr is a potentially promising target for the discovery of novel insecticides we have thus isolated and characterized the enzyme from a serious agricultural pest heliothis helicoverpa virescens the tobacco budworm sequencing tryptic peptides of the 35 000-fold purified dhfr allowed the subsequent isolation of a partial cdna with the full dhfr gene sequence obtained from a genomic library the h virescens dhfr spans 4 kb with three introns and encodes 185 amino acids the enzyme shows an overall similarity of approximately 68 with dhfr from other metazoans which has facilitated the molecular modeling of the protein dhfrs from insects appear to have strikingly reduced sensitivity to inhibition by methotrexate compared with the vertebrate enzymes and this reduction was also reflected in the total binding energy seen after modeling experiments four residues that may be characteristic of insect dhfr as well as a unique cysteine in the h virescens dhfr active site offer insight into the nature of inhibitor selectivity and provide suitable target sites for insecticide discovery
E,three hundred cdnas containing putatively entire open reading frames orfs for previously undefined genes were obtained from cd34 hematopoietic stemprogenitor cells hspcs based on est cataloging clone sequencing in silico cloning and rapid amplification of cdna ends race the cdna sizes ranged from 360 to 3496 bp and their orfs coded for peptides of 58-752 amino acids public database search indicated that 225 cdnas exhibited sequence similarities to genes identified across a variety of species homology analysis led to the recognition of 50 basic structural motifsdomains among these cdnas genomic exon-intron organization could be established in 243 genes by integration of cdna data with genome sequence information interestingly a new gene named as hspc070 on 3p was found to share a sequence of 105bp in 3' utr with raf gene in reversed transcription orientation chromosomal localizations were obtained using electronic mapping for 192 genes and with radiation hybrid rh for 38 genes macroarray technique was applied to screen the gene expression patterns in five hematopoietic cell lines nb4 hl60 u937 k562 and jurkat and a number of genes with differential expression were found the resource work has provided a wide range of information useful not only for expression genomics and annotation of genomic dna sequence but also for further research on the function of genes involved in hematopoietic development and differentiation
B,helicobacter pylori one of the most common bacterial pathogens of humans colonizes the gastric mucosa where it appears to persist throughout the host's life unless the patient is treated colonization induces chronic gastric inflammation which can progress to a variety of diseases ranging in severity from superficial gastritis and peptic ulcer to gastric cancer and mucosal-associated lymphoma strain-specific genetic diversity has been proposed to be involved in the organism's ability to cause different diseases or even be beneficial to the infected host and to participate in the lifelong chronicity of infection here we compare the complete genomic sequences of two unrelated h pylori isolates this is to our knowledge the first such genomic comparison h pylori was believed to exhibit a large degree of genomic and allelic diversity but we find that the overall genomic organization gene order and predicted proteomes sets of proteins encoded by the genomes of the two strains are quite similar between 6 to 7 of the genes are specific to each strain with almost half of these genes being clustered in a single hypervariable region
E,to study the molecular structure and function of pyruvate decarboxylase pdc from plants the protein was isolated from pea seeds and partially characterised the active enzyme which occurs in the form of higher oligomers consists of two different subunits appearing in sdspage and mass spectroscopy experiments for further experiments like x-ray crystallography it was necessary to elucidate the protein sequence partial cdna clones encoding pyruvate decarboxylase from seeds of pisum sativum cv miko have been obtained by means of polymerase chain reaction techniques the first sequences were found using degenerate oligonucleotide primers designated according to conserved amino acid sequences of known pyruvate decarboxylases the missing parts of one cdna were amplified applying the 3'- and 5'-rapid amplification of cdna ends systems the amino acid sequence deduced from the entire cdna sequence displays strong similarity to pyruvate decarboxylases from other organisms especially from plants a molecular mass of 64 kda was calculated for this protein correlating with estimations for the smaller subunit of the oligomeric enzyme the pcr experiments led to at least three different clones representing the middle part of the pdc cdna indicating the existence of three isozymes two of these isoforms could be confirmed on the protein level by sequencing tryptic peptides only anaerobically treated roots showed a positive signal for pdc mrna in northern analysis although the cdna from imbibed seeds was successfully used for pcr
E,multiple amp deaminase amp-d isoforms have been found in vertebrates and tissue-specific inherited deficiencies of amp-d have been described in two unrelated clinical syndromes suggesting there may be more than one amp-d gene in higher eukaryotes using a newly isolated cdna cloned from an adult rat brain library and a previously reported cdna cloned from adult rat skeletal muscle two linked amp-d genes have been identified in rat and man ampd1 is expressed at high levels in skeletal muscle of the adult rat ampd2 is the predominant gene expressed in non-muscle tissues and smooth muscle of the adult rat and it is also the predominant gene expressed in embryonic muscle and undifferentiated myoblasts both genes are expressed in cardiac muscle of the adult rat the peptides encoded by these two genes have distinct immunological properties the conservation of nucleotide sequence and exonintron boundaries in these two genes suggests they arose by duplication of a common primordial gene around 150 million years ago
B,in a previous work all three components of comamonas testosteroni b-356 biphenyl bphchlorobiphenyls pcbs dioxygenase dox have been purified and characterized they include an iron-sulphur protein ispbph which is the terminal oxygenase composed of two subunits encoded by bpha and bphe a ferredoxin ferbph encoded by bphf and a reductase redbph encoded by bphg bphg is not located in the neighbourhood of bphaef in b-356 we are reporting the cloning of b-356-bphg and the sequencing of b-356-bph dox genes comparative analysis of the genes provided genetic evidence showing that two bph dox lineages have emerged in gram-negative bacteria the main features of the lineage that includes b-356 are the location of bphg outside the bph gene cluster and the structure of redbph which is very distinct from all other aryl dioxygenase-reductases
B,a general l-amino acid permease aap from the abc transporter family encoded by four genes aapj q m p has been cloned and characterized in rhizobium leguminosarum it transports a wide range of l-amino acids but has a preference for those with polar side-chains a single binding protein of broad specificity aapj is required for transport of all solutes unusually for an abc transporter aap has both high affinity for and supports high rates of solute uptake genes for putative amino acid permeases with broad specificity for amino acids also exist in escherichia coli and probably in pseudomonas fluorescens although the permease from e coli does not appear to be expressed aap is an active uptake system that also affects the efflux of a broad range of amino acids efflux can be measured both as the loss of an intracellular amino acid after the addition of an excess of a homologous or heterologous amino acid and as excretion of intracellularly synthesized glutamate mutation of aap prevented efflux of intracellular amino acids caused by the addition of an extracellular heterologous amino acid while overexpression increased the rates of such efflux furthermore excretion of glutamate synthesized inside the cell was reduced by 76 in an aap strain all four gene products including the binding protein aapj appear to be needed for efflux aap from r leguminosarum expressed in e coli also promoted efflux on addition of an extracellular heterologous amino acid these results indicate either that aap regulates an efflux channeltransporter or that solute has access to the translocation pathway of aap from both sides of the membrane
B,almost all aphid species homoptera insecta have 60-80 huge cells called bacteriocytes within which are round-shaped bacteria that are designated buchnera these bacteria are maternally transmitted to eggs and embryos through host generations and the mutualism between the host and the bacteria is so obligate that neither can reproduce independently buchnera is a close relative of escherichia coli but it contains more than 100 genomic copies per cell and its genome size is only a seventh of that of e coli here we report the complete genome sequence of buchnera sp strain aps which is composed of one 640681-base-pair chromosome and two small plasmids there are genes for the biosyntheses of amino acids essential for the hosts in the genome but those for non-essential amino acids are missing indicating complementarity and syntrophy between the host and the symbiont in addition buchnera lacks genes for the biosynthesis of cell-surface components including lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids regulator genes and genes involved in defence of the cell these results indicate that buchnera is completely symbiotic and viable only in its limited niche the bacteriocyte
E,we describe the molecular characterization of the drosophila gene crumbs which encodes an integral membrane protein with 30 egf-like repeats in the extracellular part and exhibits a striking expression pattern the protein is exclusively localized on the apical membranes of epithelial cells and concentrated at the borders between cells mutations in crumbs lead to severe disruptions in the organization of ectodermally derived epithelia and in some cases to cell death in these tissues the structure and the expression pattern of the protein and the phenotype of mutations indicate a function of crumbs during the development of epithelia possibly for the establishment andor maintenance of cell polarity
E,degenerate oligonucleotides were designed on the basis of conserved amino acid sequences in the dna binding domains of the ecdysone receptors from drosophila melanogaster dmecr and chironomus tentans ctecr using these oligonucleotides a fragment encoding part of the dna binding domain of the lucilia cuprina ecdysone receptor lcecr was amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr from genomic dna and cloned this cloned fragment was used to screen a cdna library which was prepared from lucilia larvae at the late third instar a full-length lcecr gene was isolated within a 3336 bp cdna clone the conceptually translated amino acid sequence of this open reading frame 757 amino acids contained all five domains typical of a steroid hormone receptor alignment comparisons and phylogenetic analyses indicated that lcecr most closely resembled the b1 isoform of dmecr relative to other known insect steroid receptors including six insect ecrs an antisense rna probe specific for the 3' end of lcecr was used in ribonuclease protection assays to detect significant levels of lcecr mrna in embryos late third instar larvae pupae and adult females during lucilia development this pattern parallels the pattern of expression observed for dmecr mrnas during drosophila development the lcecr gene was engineered for expression in mammalian cells and we now report that the cloned lcecr is functional and can act as an ecdysteroid-dependent transcription factor in mammalian cells
E,we have isolated and characterized cdna and genomic clones representing the calmodulin gene of drosophila melanogaster as demonstrated by genomic blots and by reconstruction experiments the calmodulin gene is represented once in the drosophila genome in situ hybridization of cloned probes to the polytene chromosomes of third instar larvae permitted the localization of the gene to region 49a on the left arm of the second chromosome two transcripts of 165 and 19 kb are produced from this gene the accumulation of calmodulin message was measured at several stages of drosophila development the results of these experiments suggest developmental regulation of the gene three intervening sequences interrupt the protein coding nucleotides and two of these are located within calmodulin functional domains the dna sequence encoding the protein is presented the derived amino acid sequence is compared to that of other species the structural similarities of the drosophila calmodulin gene to calmodulin genes of other species and to other calcium binding protein genes are discussed
B,bifidobacteria are gram-positive prokaryotes that naturally colonize the human gastrointestinal tract git and vagina although not numerically dominant in the complex intestinal microflora they are considered as key commensals that promote a healthy git we determined the 226-mb genome sequence of an infant-derived strain of bifidobacterium longum and identified 1730 possible coding sequences organized in a 60-gc circular chromosome bioinformatic analysis revealed several physiological traits that could partially explain the successful adaptation of this bacteria to the colon an unexpectedly large number of the predicted proteins appeared to be specialized for catabolism of a variety of oligosaccharides some possibly released by rare or novel glycosyl hydrolases acting on nondigestible plant polymers or host-derived glycoproteins and glycoconjugates this ability to scavenge from a large variety of nutrients likely contributes to the competitiveness and persistence of bifidobacteria in the colon many genes for oligosaccharide metabolism were found in self-regulated modules that appear to have arisen in part from gene duplication or horizontal acquisition complete pathways for all amino acids nucleotides and some key vitamins were identified however routes for asp and cys were atypical more importantly genome analysis provided insights into the reciprocal interactions of bifidobacteria with their hosts we identified polypeptides that showed homology to most major proteins needed for production of glycoprotein-binding fimbriae structures that could possibly be important for adhesion and persistence in the git we also found a eukaryotic-type serine protease inhibitor serpin possibly involved in the reported immunomodulatory activity of bifidobacteria
B,the nucleotide sequence has been determined of two regions of dna cloned from the cyanobacterium synechococcus 6301 the larger 8890 base-pairs in length contains a cluster of seven genes for subunits of atp synthase the order of the genes is acb'bdeltaalphagamma b' being a duplicated and diverged form of b as in the escherichia coli unc operon the a gene is preceded by a gene for a small hydrophobic and basic protein the hydrophobic profile of the potential gene product suggests that its secondary structure is similar to the unci protein the smaller dna fragment 4737 base-pairs in length is separated from the larger by at least 15 x 103 base-pairs of dna it contains a cluster of two genes encoding atp synthase subunits beta and epsilon both clusters of atp synthase genes are preceded by sequences resembling the -10 pribnow box of e coli promoters and are followed by sequences able to form stable stem-loop structures that might serve to terminate transcription these features and the small intergenic non-coding sequences suggest that the clusters are operons for which the names atp1 and atp2 are proposed the order of genes within the two clusters is very similar to the gene order in the e coli unc operon however it is most closely related to the arrangement of genes for atp synthetase subunits acbalpha and betaepsilon in two clusters in pea chloroplast dna this close relationship between chloroplasts and the cyanobacterium is also evident from comparisons of the sequences of atp synthase subunits the synechococcus proteins are much more closely related to chloroplast homologues than to those in other bacteria or in mitochondria it is further supported by the cyanobacterial b and b' proteins which in common with their chloroplast counterpart subunit i have extra amino-terminal extensions relative to the e coli b protein this extension is known to be removed by post-translational processing in the chloroplast but its function is obscure it also seems likely that the cyanobacterial and chloroplast atp synthases have important similarities in subunit composition for example the presence of two related genes b and b' in the cyanobacterium suggests that its atp synthase is a complex of nine polypeptides and that it may have single copies of related b and b' proteins rather than two copies of identical b subunits as found in the e coli enzyme4off
E,the single calmodulin cam gene and the corresponding cdna of the chytridiomycete blastocladiella emersonii were isolated and characterized the cam gene is interrupted by three introns and transcribed in a single 07-kb mrna species encoding a predicted protein 91 identical to human cam b emersonii cam has been expressed in escherichia coli as a fusion protein with gluthatione s-transferase gst and purified by affinity chromatography and cleavage from the gst portion using a site-specific protease in the presence of ca2 b emersonii cam exhibited a shift in apparent molecular mass similar to that observed with bovine cam and was able to activate the autophosphorylation of cam-dependent protein kinase ii camkii from rat brain cam expression is developmentally regulated in b emersonii with cam mrna and protein concentrations increasing during sporulation to maximum levels observed just prior to the release of the zoospores into the medium both cam protein and mrna levels decrease drastically at the zoospore stage increasing again during germination the cam antagonists compound 4880 calmidazolium and w7 were shown to completely inhibit b emersonii sporulation when added to the cultures at least 120 150 and 180 min after induction respectively all these drugs also inhibited growth and zoospore production in this fungus the ca2 channel blocker tmb-8 and the camkii inhibitor kn93 completely inhibited sporulation if added up to 60 min after induction of this stage but only kn93 affected fungal growth the data presented suggest that the ca2-cam complex and camkii play an important role during growth and sporulation in b emersonii
B,background staphylococcus aureus is one of the major causes of community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections it produces numerous toxins including superantigens that cause unique disease entities such as toxic-shock syndrome and staphylococcal scarlet fever and has acquired resistance to practically all antibiotics whole genome analysis is a necessary step towards future development of countermeasures against this organism methods whole genome sequences of two related s aureus strains n315 and mu50 were determined by shot-gun random sequencing n315 is a meticillin-resistant s aureus mrsa strain isolated in 1982 and mu50 is an mrsa strain with vancomycin resistance isolated in 1997 the open reading frames were identified by use of gambler and glimmer programs and annotation of each was done with a blast homology search motif analysis and protein localisation prediction findings the staphylococcus genome was composed of a complex mixture of genes many of which seem to have been acquired by lateral gene transfer most of the antibiotic resistance genes were carried either by plasmids or by mobile genetic elements including a unique resistance island three classes of new pathogenicity islands were identified in the genome a toxic-shock-syndrome toxin island family exotoxin islands and enterotoxin islands in the latter two pathogenicity islands clusters of exotoxin and enterotoxin genes were found closely linked with other gene clusters encoding putative pathogenic factors the analysis also identified 70 candidates for new virulence factors interpretation the remarkable ability of s aureus to acquire useful genes from various organisms was revealed through the observation of genome complexity and evidence of lateral gene transfer repeated duplication of genes encoding superantigens explains why s aureus is capable of infecting humans of diverse genetic backgrounds eliciting severe immune reactions investigation of many newly identified gene products including the 70 putative virulence factors will greatly improve our understanding of the biology of staphylococci and the processes of infectious diseases caused by s aureus
E,a novel mouse gap junction gene coding for a presumptive protein of 258 amino acids molecular mass 28 981 da has been designated connexin29 this single copy gene was mapped to distal mouse chromosome 5 and shows 75 sequence identity to a human connexin302 sequence in the database connexin29 mrna 44 kb is highly expressed in mouse sciatic nerve and less abundant in spinal cord as well as in adult brain where it increased 12-fold between day 7 and 14 post partum our expression data suggest that the new connexin gene is active in myelin-forming glial cells
E,the national institutes of health mammalian gene collection mgc program is a multiinstitutional effort to identify and sequence a cdna clone containing a complete orf for each human and mouse gene ests were generated from libraries enriched for full-length cdnas and analyzed to identify candidate full-orf clones which then were sequenced to high accuracy the mgc has currently sequenced and verified the full orf for a nonredundant set of 9000 human and 6000 mouse genes candidate full-orf clones for an additional 7800 human and 3500 mouse genes also have been identified all mgc sequences and clones are available without restriction through public databases and clone distribution networks see httpmgcncinihgov
B,nine isolates of escherichia coli were recovered from seven blood cultures over a period of 3 months from a 19-month-old female with aplastic anemia initial isolates were susceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins including ceftazidime mic 60 or  025 microgramml but gradually became resistant to this drug mics  or  128 microgramsml and other cephalosporins and the monobactam aztreonam molecular typing methods including plasmid profile analysis pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and arbitrarily primed pcr indicated that the nine isolates were derived from a common ancestor dot blot hybridization and pcr analysis of total bacterial dna using blashv- and blatem-specific dna probes and primers identified the presence of a blatem beta-lactamase gene in all of the isolates and a blashv gene in the isolates with elevated ceftazidime mics isoelectric focusing analysis of crude lysates showed that all nine isolates contained an enzyme with a pi of 54 corresponding to the tem-1 beta-lactamase and those isolates containing an shv-type beta-lactamase demonstrated an additional band with a pi of 76 the first of the ceftazidime-resistant isolates appeared to hyperproduce the shv enzyme compared to the other resistant isolates dna sequencing revealed a blashv-1 gene in the first ceftazidime-resistant isolate and a novel blashv gene blashv-8 with an asp-to-asn substitution at amino acid position 179 in the remaining four isolates three of the ceftazidime-resistant isolates also showed a change in porin profile the patient had received multiple courses of antimicrobial agents during her illness including multiple courses of ceftazidime this collection of blood isolates from the same patient appears to represent the in vivo evolution of resistance under selective pressure of treatment with various cephalosporins
E,proteins belonging to the troponin c superfamily troponin c calmodulin myosin light chains and parvalbumin are involved in a wide variety of cellular activities mediated by calcium ions most of these proteins bind ionic calcium and all have calcium binding domains that are conserved to some extent at the nucleic acid level we made use of the conservation in the third calcium binding domain to synthesize two consensus sequence oligonucleotide probes one 43 bases and the other 25 bases long by using cdna and genomic clones encoding calmodulin troponin c parvalbumin and the sea urchin spec proteins we show that these probes hybridize with nucleic acid sequences representing calcium binding domains in an rna gel blot analysis of embryonic rna from the sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus we show that transcripts which have previously been shown to encode troponin c like proteins hybridize with the consensus sequence probes screening sea urchin cdna and genomic libraries with the 43-base consensus oligonucleotide shows that the probe can be used to isolate cloned nucleic acids two such genomic clones from a lytechinus pictus library were isolated and characterized one clone encodes part of an l pictus calmodulin gene and the other encodes a member of the superfamily that has not been characterized previously the consensus oligonucleotides should be valuable probes in the diagnosis and isolation of nucleic acids encoding proteins of the troponin c superfamily
B,ralstonia solanacearum is a devastating soil-borne plant pathogen with a global distribution and an unusually wide host range it is a model system for the dissection of molecular determinants governing pathogenicity we present here the complete genome sequence and its analysis of strain gmi1000 the 58-megabase mb genome is organized into two replicons a 37-mb chromosome and a 21-mb megaplasmid both replicons have a mosaic structure providing evidence for the acquisition of genes through horizontal gene transfer regions containing genetically mobile elements associated with the percentage of gc bias may have an important function in genome evolution the genome encodes many proteins potentially associated with a role in pathogenicity in particular many putative attachment factors were identified the complete repertoire of type iii secreted effector proteins can be studied over 40 candidates were identified comparison with other genomes suggests that bacterial plant pathogens and animal pathogens harbour distinct arrays of specialized type iii-dependent effectors
E,we isolated two rice cdna clones ric1 and ric2 encoding proteins homologous to the ras-related small gtp-binding protein the amino acid sequences of ric1 and ric2 are conserved in four regions involved in gtp binding and hydrolysis which are characteristic in the ras and ras-related small gtp-binding protein genes in addition two consecutive cysteine residues near the carboxyl-terminal end required for membrane anchoring are also present in ric1 and ric2 the ric1 and ric2 proteins synthesized in escherichia coli possessed gtpase activity ie hydrolysis of gtp to gdp
E,arabidopsis thaliana arabidopsis is unique among plant model organisms in having a small genome 130-140 mb excellent physical and genetic maps and little repetitive dna here we report the sequence of chromosome 2 from the columbia ecotype in two gap-free assemblies contigs of 36 and 16 megabases mb the latter represents the longest published stretch of uninterrupted dna sequence assembled from any organism to date chromosome 2 represents 15 of the genome and encodes 4037 genes 49 of which have no predicted function roughly 250 tandem gene duplications were found in addition to large-scale duplications of about 05 and 45 mb between chromosomes 2 and 1 and between chromosomes 2 and 4 respectively sequencing of nearly 2 mb within the genetically defined centromere revealed a low density of recognizable genes and a high density and diverse range of vestigial and presumably inactive mobile elements more unexpected is what appears to be a recent insertion of a continuous stretch of 75 of the mitochondrial genome into chromosome 2
B,the entire genome of a thermophilic unicellular cyanobacterium thermosynechococcus elongatus bp-1 was sequenced the genome consisted of a circular chromosome 2593857 bp long and no plasmid was detected a total of 2475 potential protein-encoding genes one set of rrna genes 42 trna genes representing 42 trna species and 4 genes for small structural rnas were assigned to the chromosome by similarity search and computer prediction the translated products of 56 of the potential protein-encoding genes showed sequence similarity to experimentally identified and predicted proteins of known function and the products of 34 of these genes showed sequence similarity to the translated products of hypothetical genes the remaining 10 lacked significant similarity to genes for predicted proteins in the public dna databases sixty-three percent of the t elongatus genes showed significant sequence similarity to those of both synechocystis sp pcc 6803 and anabaena sp pcc 7120 while 22 of the genes were unique to this species indicating a high degree of divergence of the gene information among cyanobacterial strains the lack of genes for typical fatty acid desaturases and the presence of more genes for heat-shock proteins in comparison with other mesophilic cyanobacteria may be genomic features of thermophilic strains a remarkable feature of the genome is the presence of 28 copies of group ii introns 8 of which contained a presumptive gene for maturasereverse transcriptase a trace of genome rearrangement mediated by the group ii introns was also observed
B,listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen with a high mortality rate that has also emerged as a paradigm for intracellular parasitism we present and compare the genome sequences of l monocytogenes 2944528 base pairs and a nonpathogenic species l innocua 3011209 base pairs we found a large number of predicted genes encoding surface and secreted proteins transporters and transcriptional regulators consistent with the ability of both species to adapt to diverse environments the presence of 270 l monocytogenes and 149 l innocua strain-specific genes clustered in 100 and 63 islets respectively suggests that virulence in listeria results from multiple gene acquisition and deletion events
B,clostridium perfringens is a gram-positive anaerobic spore-forming bacterium that causes life-threatening gas gangrene and mild enterotoxaemia in humans although it colonizes as normal intestinal flora of humans and animals the organism is known to produce a variety of toxins and enzymes that are responsible for the severe myonecrotic lesions here we report the complete 3031430-bp sequence of c perfringens strain 13 that comprises 2660 protein coding regions and 10 rrna genes showing pronounced low overall g  c content 286 the genome contains typical anaerobic fermentation enzymes leading to gas production but no enzymes for the tricarboxylic acid cycle or respiratory chain various saccharolytic enzymes were found but many enzymes for amino acid biosynthesis were lacking in the genome twenty genes were newly identified as putative virulence factors of c perfringens and we found a total of five hyaluronidase genes that will also contribute to virulence the genome analysis also proved an efficient method for finding four members of the two-component virrvirs regulon that coordinately regulates the pathogenicity of c perfringens clearly c perfringens obtains various essential materials from the host by producing several degradative enzymes and toxins resulting in massive destruction of the host tissues
B,gene aadk of bacillus subtilis is 855 bp long and codes for aminoglycoside 6-adenylyltransferase
B,the 567-megabase genome of the plant pathogen agrobacterium tumefaciens c58 consists of a circular chromosome a linear chromosome and two plasmids extensive orthology and nucleotide colinearity between the genomes of a tumefaciens and the plant symbiont sinorhizobium meliloti suggest a recent evolutionary divergence their similarities include metabolic transport and regulatory systems that promote survival in the highly competitive rhizosphere differences are apparent in their genome structure and virulence gene complement availability of the a tumefaciens sequence will facilitate investigations into the molecular basis of pathogenesis and the evolutionary divergence of pathogenic and symbiotic lifestyles
B,azospirillum brasilense isolated from the rhizosphere of different plants has the ability to excrete indole-3-acetic acid iaa into the culture media cosmid p02 isolated from an a brasilense sp245 genome library in plafr1 complements the tn5-induced mutant spm7918 of a brasilense sp6 which excretes reduced amounts of iaa restriction mapping and gene expression studies identified a bglii-ecori 43 kb fragment of p02 sufficient for the restoration of high levels of iaa production in mutant spm7918 tn5 mutagenesis localized the gene responsible on a 18 kb smai fragment nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that this fragment contains one complete open reading frame the predicted protein sequence shows extensive homology with the indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase of enterobacter cloacae and the pyruvate decarboxylases of saccharomyces cerevisiae and zymomonas mobilis the a brasilense mutant sp245a constructed by homogenotization of a tn5 insertion derivative of the 18 kb smai fragment also displayed reduced iaa production introduction of the cloned wild-type gene into rhizobium meliloti 1021 resulted in increased iaa production cell-free extracts prepared from r meliloti and a brasilense transconjugants harboring this gene could convert indole-3-pyruvic acid to indole-3-acetaldehyde and tryptophol these results clearly demonstrate that iaa production in a brasilense is mediated by indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase
B,oceanobacillus iheyensis hte831 is an alkaliphilic and extremely halotolerant bacillus-related species isolated from deep-sea sediment we present here the complete genome sequence of hte831 along with analyses of genes required for adaptation to highly alkaline and saline environments the genome consists of 36 mb encoding many proteins potentially associated with roles in regulation of intracellular osmotic pressure and ph homeostasis the candidate genes involved in alkaliphily were determined based on comparative analysis with three bacillus species and two other gram-positive species comparison with the genomes of other major gram-positive bacterial species suggests that the backbone of the genus bacillus is composed of approximately 350 genes this second genome sequence of an alkaliphilic bacillus-related species will be useful in understanding life in highly alkaline environments and microbial diversity within the ubiquitous bacilli
B,sequencing of orf10 gene cmch of the nocardia lactamdurans cephamycin gene cluster proved that it encodes a protein with a deduced molecular mass of 57149 da this protein showed significant similarity to the putative o-carbamoyltransferases o-cases encoded by the nodu genes of rhizobium fredii and bradyrhizobium japonicum involved in the synthesis of nodulation factors the carbamoyl-phosphate cp-binding amino-acid sequence of human otcase is conserved in the cmch product a similar cmch 80 identify in a 160-nt fragment in the cephamycin cmc cluster of cmc genes of streptomyces clavuligerus was partially sequenced the cmch gene is closely linked to and in the same orientation as ceff in both organisms both cmch were subcloned in pij702 and expressed in streptomyces lividans extracts of transformants could carbamoylate decarbamoylcefuroxime a similar cmch was found by southern hybridization in streptomyces cattleya but not in streptomyces griseus or streptomyces lipmanii which produce non-carbamoylated cmc
B,the dna sequence of a 136-kb segment 815 to 845 min from the escherichia coli origin of replication region has been determined and analyzed of the 122 protein coding regions that were found we could assign no gene name or function to half of them even in this well-studied part of the genome the newly sequenced region also includes five rna genes the arrangement of open reading frames and potential promoters suggests 63 transcription units the sequence was also analyzed for bend sites and two types of repeated sequence elements together with our sequence of the 845 to 865 min region this new determination forms a 227-kb contiguous region centered on oric a global analysis of this region reveals a remarkable symmetry most genes are transcribed divergently from the replication origin and chi octanucleotide 5'gctggtgg3' recombinational hot spots are also strikingly oriented with respect to the directions of replication and translation
B,the dna sequence of 965 kilobases of the escherichia coli k-12 genome has been determined spanning the region between rrna at 872 minutes and katg at 892 minutes on the genetic map the sequence includes 84 open reading frames of which 46 code for unidentified proteins six previously mapped but unsequenced genes have been identified in this span mob fdhd rhad rhaa rhab and kdgt in addition five new genes have been assigned the heat shock genes hsiu and hsiv and the genes fdog fdoh and fdoi which encode the three subunits of formate dehydrogenase-o the arrangement of the genes relative to possible promoters and terminators suggests 57 potential transcription units other features include the precise location of the bacteriophage p2 attachment site attp2ii and eleven rep elements including one containing 9 rep sequences--one of the largest such elements known this segment brings the total length of contiguous finished sequence to 325 kilobases
B,the gene for a disulfide oxidoreductase was cloned and sequenced from azotobacter vinelandii and termed the dsba locus the deduced amino acid sequence contains 214 residues with a potential 17-residue signaling sequence on the n-terminal end this gives the mature protein a calculated molecular mass of 21 799 da the a vinelandii dsba protein contains the well-conserved motif of c-p-h-c which is found in the catalytic site of other bacterial dsba enzymes the a vinelandii dsba gene was expressed in escherichia coli and was found to be able to complement an e coli dsba mutant strain by restoring flagellar and alkaline phosphatase activities a vinelandii dsba mutant strains were impossible to characterize because of the extreme deleterious effect of the mutation therefore the in vivo role of a vinelandii dsba is unknown but it may function to form disulfide bonds andor be involved in cytochrome biogenesis
E,we cloned p27kip1 a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor implicated in g1 phase arrest by tgf beta and cell-cell contact p27kip1 associates with cyclin e-cdk2 complexes in vivo and in vitro prevents their activation and inhibits previously activated complexes and p27kip1 overexpression obstructs cell entry into s phase p27kip1 potently inhibits rb phosphorylation by cyclin e-cdk2 cyclin a-cdk2 and cyclin d2-cdk4 p27kip1 is highly conserved and broadly expressed in human tissues and its mrna levels are similar in proliferating and quiescent cells p27kip1 has a region of sequence similarity to p21cip1waf1 the cdk inhibitor whose transcription is stimulated by p53 a p27kip1 peptide corresponding to this region retains cdk inhibitory activity we suggest that cell contact tgf beta and p53 all restrain cell proliferation through related cdk inhibitors
B,comparative sequence analysis of small subunit rrna is currently one of the most important methods for the elucidation of bacterial phylogeny as well as bacterial identification phylogenetic investigations targeting alternative phylogenetic markers such as large subunit rrna elongation factors and atpases have shown that 16s rrna-based trees reflect the history of the corresponding organisms globally however in comparison with three to four billion years of evolution the phylogenetic information content of these markers is limited consequently the limited resolution power of the marker molecules allows only a spot check of the evolutionary history of microorganisms this is often indicated by locally different topologies of trees based on different markers data sets or the application of different treeing approaches sequence peculiarities as well as methods and parameters for data analysis were studied with respect to their effects on the results of phylogenetic investigations it is shown that only careful data analysis starting with a proper alignment followed by the analysis of positional variability rates and character of change testing various data selections applying alternative treeing methods and finally performing confidence tests allows reasonable utilization of the limited phylogenetic information
E,elicitins proteinaceous elicitors secreted by phytophthora spp act as inducers of a hypersensitive-like response in tobacco during incompatible interactions we have isolated and cloned sequences encoding cryptogein and related isoforms from p cryptogea that belong to the elicitin family the isolation of a genomic clone led to the characterization of four clustered genes two of these genes encode distinct elicitins and two genes would encode if expressed a class of highly acidic elicitins which had not been observed so far northern blots indicate that elicitin genes are expressed in the fungus grown in vitro though at different levels southern hybridization revealed that elicitins are encoded by a multigene family in several other species of phytophthora moreover isolates of phytophthora parasitica var nicotianae pathogenic to tobacco which do not produce elicitins possess several elicitin-encoding genes involvement of elicitins in plant-pathogen interactions is discussed
E,we have used a genomic library of candida albicans to transform saccharomyces cerevisiae and screened for genes that act similarly to dominant negative mutations by interfering with pheromone-mediated cell cycle arrest six different plasmids were identified from 2000 transformants four have been sequenced one gene czf1 encodes a protein with structural motifs characteristic of a transcription factor a second gene ccn1 encodes a cyclin homologue a third crl1 encodes a protein with sequence similarity to gtp-binding proteins of the rho family and a fourth cek1 encodes a putative kinase of the erk family since cek1 confers a phenotype similar to that of the structurally related s cerevisiae gene kss1 but cannot complement a kss1 defect it is evident that dominant negative selection can identify proteins that complementation screens would miss because dominant negative mutations exert their influence even in wild-type strain backgrounds this approach should be a general method for the analysis of complex cellular processes in organisms not amenable to direct genetic analysis
E,clones of cdna that code for an isoform of the artemia franciscana nak atpase alpha subunit naka alpha have been isolated the sequence of the longest of these clones paratna136 is 3595 nucleotides it codes for a 1004-amino acid protein whose sequence is identical to that of two previously sequenced artemia naka alpha peptides the encoded protein is over 73 identical to drosophila melanogaster and vertebrate naka alpha s and 738 identical to another artemia naka alpha isoform previously described named alpha 2850 in this article the two artemia cdna clones code for mrnas of different size the clone paratna136 codes for a 45-kb mrna while the alpha 2850 clone codes for a 36-kb mrna the degree of homology and the different size of the mrnas encoded by both cdnas suggest that they code for two different isoforms of the protein
B,the gram-negative bacterium yersinia pestis is the causative agent of the systemic invasive infectious disease classically referred to as plague and has been responsible for three human pandemics the justinian plague sixth to eighth centuries the black death fourteenth to nineteenth centuries and modern plague nineteenth century to the present day the recent identification of strains resistant to multiple drugs and the potential use of y pestis as an agent of biological warfare mean that plague still poses a threat to human health here we report the complete genome sequence of y pestis strain co92 consisting of a 465-megabase mb chromosome and three plasmids of 962 kilobases kb 703 kb and 96 kb the genome is unusually rich in insertion sequences and displays anomalies in gc base-composition bias indicating frequent intragenomic recombination many genes seem to have been acquired from other bacteria and viruses including adhesins secretion systems and insecticidal toxins the genome contains around 150 pseudogenes many of which are remnants of a redundant enteropathogenic lifestyle the evidence of ongoing genome fluidity expansion and decay suggests y pestis is a pathogen that has undergone large-scale genetic flux and provides a unique insight into the ways in which new and highly virulent pathogens evolve
E,the nucleotide sequence of a human blym-1 transforming gene activated in a burkitt's lymphoma cell line was determined this sequence predicts a small protein of 58 amino acids that is 33 percent identical to the predicted product of chicken blym-1 the activated transforming gene of chicken b cell lymphomas both the human and chicken blym-1 genes exhibit significant identity to an amino-terminal region of transferrins
B,pseudomonas putida is a metabolically versatile saprophytic soil bacterium that has been certified as a biosafety host for the cloning of foreign genes the bacterium also has considerable potential for biotechnological applications sequence analysis of the 618 mb genome of strain kt2440 reveals diverse transport and metabolic systems although there is a high level of genome conservation with the pathogenic pseudomonad pseudomonas aeruginosa 85 of the predicted coding regions are shared key virulence factors including exotoxin a and type iii secretion systems are absent analysis of the genome gives insight into the non-pathogenic nature of p putida and points to potential new applications in agriculture biocatalysis bioremediation and bioplastic production
B,we have sequenced the genome of shigella flexneri serotype 2a the most prevalent species and serotype that causes bacillary dysentery or shigellosis in man the whole genome is composed of a 4 607 203 bp chromosome and a 221 618 bp virulence plasmid designated pcp301 while the plasmid shows minor divergence from that sequenced in serotype 5a striking characteristics of the chromosome have been revealed the sflexneri chromosome has astonishingly 314 is elements more than 7-fold over those possessed by its close relatives the non-pathogenic k12 strain and enterohemorrhagic o157h7 strain of escherichia coli there are 13 translocations and inversions compared with the ecoli sequences all involve a segment larger than 5 kb and most are associated with deletions or acquired dna sequences of which several are likely to be bacteriophage-transmitted pathogenicity islands furthermore sflexneri resembling another human-restricted enteric pathogen salmonella typhi also has hundreds of pseudogenes compared with the ecoli strains all of these could be subjected to investigations towards novel preventative and treatment strategies against shigellosis
E,multiple isozymes of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases pdes are expressed simultaneously in mammalian tissues to identify and clone these pdes a polymerase chain reaction pcr strategy was developed using degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed to hybridize with highly conserved pde dna domains both known and novel pdes were cloned from rat liver the mouse k30a-33 lymphoma cell line and a human hypothalamus cdna library demonstrating that these pcr primers can be used to amplify the cdna of multiple pde isozymes one unique mouse pde clone was found to encode a polypeptide identical with the corresponding portion of the bovine brain 63-kda calmodulin-dependent pde as reported in the companion article bentley j k kadlecek a sherbert c h seger d sonnenburg w k charbonneau h novack j p and beavo j a 1992 j biol chem 267 18676-18682 this mouse clone was used as a probe to screen a rat brain cdna library for a full-length clone the conceptual translation of the nucleotide sequence of the resulting rat clone has an open reading frame of 535 amino acids and maintains a high degree of homology with the bovine 63-kda calmodulin-dependent pde indicating that this protein is likely to be the rat homolog of the 63-kda calmodulin-dependent pde expression of the full-length clone in escherichia coli yielded a cgmp hydrolyzing activity that was stimulated severalfold by calmodulin northern blot analysis demonstrated that the mrna encoding this pde is highly expressed in rat brain and also in the s491 t-lymphocyte cell line these data demonstrate that the pcr method described is a viable strategy to isolate cdna clones of known and novel members of different families of pde isozymes molecular cloning of these pdes will provide valuable tools for investigating the roles of these isozymes in regulation of intracellular concentrations of the cyclic nucleotides
E,we have isolated the murine homologs of the members of the coup-family of steroid hormone receptors coup-tf1 arp-1 and ear2 the proteins encoded by the murine genes appeared to be highly conserved when compared to their human counterparts the expression of coup-tf1 and arp-1 was induced during differentiation of p19 embryonal carcinoma ec cells into derivatives of all three germ layers retinoic acid ra treatment rapidly induced expression of both genes while other methods of differentiation were less effective undifferentiated p19 cells were found to express ear2 mrna and the expression level was only slightly elevated by ra-treatment in addition we analyzed the expression in p19 cells of three members of the retinoid x receptor rxr family which have been shown to heterodimerize with members of the coup-family during ra mediated differentiation of p19 cells rxr alpha expression was induced while rxr beta expression was not modulated and rxr gamma expression was down regulated gel shift analysis revealed that in p19 cells the members of the coup-family comprise the major portion of proteins binding to a ra-responsive direct repeat of the consensus steroid hormone receptor binding half site aggtca spaced by one nucleotide dr  1 the members of the coup-family appeared to down regulate ra-induced activation of ra-response element-containing reporter constructs in a promoter context-dependent manner the expression patterns of coup-tf1 arp-1 and ear2 during development were investigated by in situ hybridization in agreement with the results obtained in vitro the three genes appeared to be expressed in tissues derived from all three germ layers however coup-tf1 and arp-1 were found to be expressed predominantly in the developing central nervous system in mutually exclusive domains furthermore strong arp-1 expression was detected in lung and kidney our data strongly suggest an important role for the members of the coup-family in the hormonal control of gene expression regulating embryogenesis
B,many insects that rely on a single food source throughout their developmental cycle harbor beneficial microbes that provide nutrients absent from their restricted diet tsetse flies the vectors of african trypanosomes feed exclusively on blood and rely on one such intracellular microbe for nutritional provisioning and fecundity as a result of co-evolution with hosts over millions of years these mutualists have lost the ability to survive outside the sheltered environment of their host insect cells we present the complete annotated genome of wigglesworthia glossinidia brevipalpis which is composed of one chromosome of 697724 base pairs bp and one small plasmid called pwig1 of 5200 bp genes involved in the biosynthesis of vitamin metabolites apparently essential for host nutrition and fecundity have been retained unexpectedly this obligate's genome bears hallmarks of both parasitic and free-living microbes and the gene encoding the important regulatory protein dnaa is absent
B,despite numerous studies on bacterial motility little is known about the regulation of this process by environmental factors in natural isolates in this study we investigated the control of bacterial motility in response to environmental parameters in two strains isolated from the natural habitat of lake baikal morphological characterization carbon source utilization fermentation analysis and sequence comparison of 16s rrna genes showed that these strains belong to two distinct genera ie enterobacter and pseudomonas they were named strains 22 and y1000 respectively both strains swarmed at 25 degrees c and remained motile at low temperatures 4 degrees c especially the pseudomonas strain which further supports the psychrotrophic characteristics of this strain in contrast a strong inhibition of motility was observed at above 30 degrees c and with a high nacl concentration the existence of flagellar regulatory proteins flhdc and fleq was demonstrated in enterobacter strain 22 and pseudomonas strain y1000 respectively and environmental conditions reduced the expression of the structural genes potentially located at the first level in the flagellar cascade in both organisms finally as in enterobacter strain 22 a strong reduction in the transcription of the master regulatory gene fleq was observed in pseudomonas strain y1000 in the presence of novobiocin a dna gyrase inhibitor suggesting a link between dna supercoiling and motility control by environmental factors thus striking similarities observed in the two organisms suggest that these processes have evolved toward a similar regulatory mechanism in polarly flagellated and laterally flagellated peritrichous bacteria
A,the complete genomic sequence of the archaeon thermoplasma volcanium possessing optimum growth temperature ogt of 60 degrees c is reported by systematically comparing this genomic sequence with the other known genomic sequences of archaea all possessing higher ogt a number of strong correlations have been identified between characteristics of genomic organization and the ogt with increasing ogt in the genomic dna frequency of clustering purines and pyrimidines into separate dinucleotides rises eg by often forming aa and tt whereas avoiding ta and at proteins coded in a genome are divided into two distinct subpopulations possessing isoelectric points in different ranges ie acidic and basic and with increasing ogt the size of the basic subpopulation becomes larger at the metabolic level genes coding for enzymes mediating pathways for synthesizing some coenzymes such as heme start missing these findings provide insights into the design of individual genomic components as well as principles for coordinating changes in these designs for the adaptation to new environments
E,we have cloned and sequenced the plastid atpase operons atp1 and atp2 and flanking regions from the unicellular red alga galdieria sulphuraria cyanidium caldarium six genes 5 atpi h g f d and a 3 are linked in atp1 encoding atpase subunits a c b b delta and alpha respectively the atpf gene does not contain an intron and overlaps atpd by 1 bp as in the genome of chloroplasts from land plants the cluster is located downstream of rps2 but between this gene and atp1 we found the gene for the prokaryotic translation elongation factor ts downstream of atpa we detected two open reading frames one encoding a putative transport protein the genes atpb and atpe encoding atpase subunits beta and epsilon respectively are linked in atp2 separated by a 2 bp spacer upstream of atpb an uninterrupted orf167 was detected which is homologous to an intron-containing open reading frame in land plant chloroplasts this orf167 is preceded on the opposite dna strand by a homologue to initiation factor 2 in prokaryotes the arrangement of atp1 and atp2 is the same as observed in the multicellular red alga antithamnion sp indicating a conserved genome arrangement in the red algal plastid genome differences compared to green chloroplast genomes suggest a large phylogenetic distance between red algae and green plants while similarities in arrangement and sequence to chromophytic atpase operons support a red algal origin of chlorophyll ac-containing plastids or alternatively point to a common prokaryotic endosymbiont
E,only a small proportion of the mouse genome is transcribed into mature messenger rna transcripts there is an international collaborative effort to identify all full-length mrna transcripts from the mouse and to ensure that each is represented in a physical collection of clones here we report the manual annotation of 60770 full-length mouse complementary dna sequences these are clustered into 33409 'transcriptional units' contributing 901 of a newly established mouse transcriptome database of these transcriptional units 4258 are new protein-coding and 11665 are new non-coding messages indicating that non-coding rna is a major component of the transcriptome 41 of all transcriptional units showed evidence of alternative splicing in protein-coding transcripts 79 of splice variations altered the protein product whole-transcriptome analyses resulted in the identification of 2431 sense-antisense pairs the present work completely supported by physical clones provides the most comprehensive survey of a mammalian transcriptome so far and is a valuable resource for functional genomics
V,one of the striking molecular aspects of the human t-cell lymphotropic virus type iii htlv-iii now called hiv-1 is an unusually large variability in the env genes of different isolates these differences are clustered primarily within the coding sequences for the large envelope protein and are interspersed among regions within the env gene of relative constancy differences among the envelopes of isolates from africa are so far greater than those among us isolates but few us isolates have been characterized to date we report the sequence of the env gene of two us isolates htlv-iiimn and sc and compare them with previously characterized isolates these two isolates differ substantially from all previously described isolates especially in the region coding for the large envelope proteins the env genes of the two new hiv-1 isolates contain conserved and hypervariable regions similar to what has been reported for other isolates helping to further define those regions a comparison of the envelope sequences of all the us isolates shows that the similarity between any two ranges from 81 to 85 except for lavbru and htlv-iiibh10 which are 97 similar similar analyses of the african zairean isolates give significantly lower values 71 to 78 except for 88 between laveli and z6 this suggests that the african isolates diverged earlier than the us isolates or that transmission of the virus has been more rapid in africa two previous presumptive haitian isolates are similar to each other and to the us isolates to the same degree as are other us isolates but differ more markedly from the african isolates suggesting a common lineage of haitian and us hiv-1 isolates
B,pseudomonas putida is a metabolically versatile saprophytic soil bacterium that has been certified as a biosafety host for the cloning of foreign genes the bacterium also has considerable potential for biotechnological applications sequence analysis of the 618 mb genome of strain kt2440 reveals diverse transport and metabolic systems although there is a high level of genome conservation with the pathogenic pseudomonad pseudomonas aeruginosa 85 of the predicted coding regions are shared key virulence factors including exotoxin a and type iii secretion systems are absent analysis of the genome gives insight into the non-pathogenic nature of p putida and points to potential new applications in agriculture biocatalysis bioremediation and bioplastic production
E,we have isolated cdna of genes that are preferentially expressed during somatic embryogenesis of carrot daucus carota l by differential screening of globular embryos and cells that are dividing in an unorganized manner as a result of northern-blot analysis one of the genes identified in this way which we refer to as cem1 was found to be expressed at high levels in somatic embryos at the globular and heart-shaped stages in-situ hybridization using globular embryos revealed that the mrna transcribed from cem1 was located preferentially in the spherical region of the globular embryo a homology search using the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cem1 cdna revealed that cem1 encodes the eukaryotic translational elongation-factor 1 alpha
E,wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper transport disease symptoms develop from the toxic build-up of copper primarily in the liver and subsequently in the brain kidney cornea and other tissues a candidate gene for wd atp7b has recently been identified based upon apparent disease-specific mutations and a striking amino acid homology to the gene atp7a responsible for another human copper transport disorder x-linked menkes disease mnk the cloning of wd and mnk genes provides the first opportunity to study copper homeostasis in humans a preliminary analysis of the wd gene is presented which includes isolation and characterization of the 5'-end of the gene construction of a genomic restriction map identification of all 21 exonintron boundaries characterization of extensive alternative splicing in brain prediction of structurefunction features of the wd and mnk proteins which are unique to the subset of heavy metal-transporting p-type atpases and comparative analysis of the six metal-binding domains the analysis indicates that wd and mnk proteins belong to a subset of transporting atpases with several unique features presumably reflecting their specific regulation and function it appears that the mechanism of alternative splicing serves to regulate the amount of functional wd protein produced in brain kidney placenta and possibly in liver
E,the cysb gene of a nidulans was cloned by complementation of a cysb mutation this is the first cloned eukaryotic genomic sequence coding for cysteine synthase the gene contains one 71-bp intron and codes for a protein of 370 amino acids its n-terminal region has characteristic features of transit peptides suggesting mitochondrial localisation of the enzyme the protein shows homology with bacterial and plant cysteine synthases among which it occupies a remote phylogenetic position and apparently represents a distinct subfamily transcription of the cysb gene is not appreciably regulated by the concentration of methionine in the growth medium
E,tandemly duplicated actin genes have been isolated from a helicoverpa armigera genomic library sequence comparisons with actin genes from other species suggest they encode cytoplasmic actins being most closely related to the bombyx mori a3 actin gene the duplicated h armigera actin genes termed a3a and a3b share 983 nucleotide sequence identity over their entire putative coding region analysis of the distribution of nucleotide differences shows the first 763 bp are identical between the two coding regions with the 18 nucleotide changes occurring in the remaining 366 bp this observation suggests a gene conversion event has taken place between the duplicated h armigera a3a and a3b actin genes translation of the open-reading frames indicates the products of these genes are identical apart from a single amino acid difference at codon 273 polymerase chain reaction and northern blot analysis have shown both h armigera a3a and a3b genes are expressed during pupal development and in the brain of newly enclosed adults a region 5' of the h armigera a3a actin gene start codon has been identified which contains regulatory sequences commonly found in the promoter region of actin genes including tata caat and carg motifs
E,twelve proteins from calcified regions and five from flexible regions arthrodial membranes of the exoskeleton of cancer pagurus have been purified and sequenced one of the proteins from calcified exoskeleton is identical to one of the arthrodial membrane proteins several of the proteins from the calcified regions resemble proteins from corresponding regions of the exoskeleton of the lobster homarus americanus in containing either two or four copies of an 18-residue sequence motif which so far has been found only in crustacean calcified exoskeletons the proteins obtained from the flexible arthrodial membranes resemble the proteins from lobster arthrodial membranes and the similarities are shared with a number of proteins from flexible cuticles in insects indicating that the common features in these proteins may be important for the mechanical properties of the materials in which they occur
B,we present the complete genome sequence of uropathogenic escherichia coli strain cft073 a three-way genome comparison of the cft073 enterohemorrhagic e coli edl933 and laboratory strain mg1655 reveals that amazingly only 392 of their combined nonredundant set of proteins actually are common to all three strains the pathogen genomes are as different from each other as each pathogen is from the benign strain the difference in disease potential between o157h7 and cft073 is reflected in the absence of genes for type iii secretion system or phage- and plasmid-encoded toxins found in some classes of diarrheagenic e coli the cft073 genome is particularly rich in genes that encode potential fimbrial adhesins autotransporters iron-sequestration systems and phase-switch recombinases striking differences exist between the large pathogenicity islands of cft073 and two other well-studied uropathogenic e coli strains j96 and 536 comparisons indicate that extraintestinal pathogenic e coli arose independently from multiple clonal lineages the different e coli pathotypes have maintained a remarkable synteny of common vertically evolved genes whereas many islands interrupting this common backbone have been acquired by different horizontal transfer events in each strain
E,awn is a boar protein which originates in secretions of the male accessory glands and which becomes sperm surface-associated upon ejaculation it is one of the components thought to mediate sperm adhesion to the egg's zona pellucida through a carbohydrate-recognition mechanism awn may thus participate in the initial events of fertilization in the pig in this report we describe its complete primary structure by combination of protein-chemical and mass spectrometric methods awn exists as two isoforms awn-1 and awn-2 which differ in that awn-2 is n-terminally acetylated the amino acid sequence of awn contains 133 amino acid residues and two disulphide bridges between nearest-neighbour cysteine residues analysis of the amino acid sequence of the awn proteins showed significant similarity only to aqn-1 and aqn-3 two other boar spermadhesins
A,the archaeon methanosarcina mazei and related species are of great ecological importance as they are the only organisms fermenting acetate methylamines and methanol to methane carbon dioxide and ammonia in case of methylamines since acetate is the precursor of 60 of the methane produced on earth these organisms contribute significantly to the production of this greenhouse gas eg in rice paddies the 4096345 base pairs circular chromosome of m mazei is more than twice as large as the genomes of the methanogenic archaea currently completely sequenced bult et al 1996 smith et al 1997 3371 open reading frames orfs were identified based on currently available sequence data 376 of these orfs are methanosarcina-specific and 1043 orfs find their closest homologue in the bacterial domain 544 of these orfs reach significant similarity values only in the bacterial domain they include 56 of the 102 transposases and proteins involved in gluconeogenesis proline biosynthesis transport processes dna-repair environmental sensing gene regulation and stress response striking examples are the occurrence of the bacterial groelgroes chaperone system and the presence of tetrahydrofolate-dependent enzymes these findings might indicate that lateral gene transfer has played an important evolutionary role in forging the physiology of this metabolically versatile methanogen
B,streptococcus agalactiae is a commensal bacterium colonizing the intestinal tract of a significant proportion of the human population however it is also a pathogen which is the leading cause of invasive infections in neonates and causes septicaemia meningitis and pneumonia we sequenced the genome of the serogroup iii strain nem316 responsible for a fatal case of septicaemia the genome is 2 211 485 base pairs long and contains 2118 protein coding genes fifty-five per cent of the predicted genes have an ortholog in the streptococcus pyogenes genome representing a conserved backbone between these two streptococci among the genes in s agalactiae that lack an ortholog in s pyogenes 50 are clustered within 14 islands these islands contain known and putative virulence genes mostly encoding surface proteins as well as a number of genes related to mobile elements some of these islands could therefore be considered as pathogenicity islands compared with other pathogenic streptococci s agalactiae shows the unique feature that pathogenicity islands may have an important role in virulence acquisition and in genetic diversity
B,background staphylococcus aureus is one of the major causes of community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections it produces numerous toxins including superantigens that cause unique disease entities such as toxic-shock syndrome and staphylococcal scarlet fever and has acquired resistance to practically all antibiotics whole genome analysis is a necessary step towards future development of countermeasures against this organism methods whole genome sequences of two related s aureus strains n315 and mu50 were determined by shot-gun random sequencing n315 is a meticillin-resistant s aureus mrsa strain isolated in 1982 and mu50 is an mrsa strain with vancomycin resistance isolated in 1997 the open reading frames were identified by use of gambler and glimmer programs and annotation of each was done with a blast homology search motif analysis and protein localisation prediction findings the staphylococcus genome was composed of a complex mixture of genes many of which seem to have been acquired by lateral gene transfer most of the antibiotic resistance genes were carried either by plasmids or by mobile genetic elements including a unique resistance island three classes of new pathogenicity islands were identified in the genome a toxic-shock-syndrome toxin island family exotoxin islands and enterotoxin islands in the latter two pathogenicity islands clusters of exotoxin and enterotoxin genes were found closely linked with other gene clusters encoding putative pathogenic factors the analysis also identified 70 candidates for new virulence factors interpretation the remarkable ability of s aureus to acquire useful genes from various organisms was revealed through the observation of genome complexity and evidence of lateral gene transfer repeated duplication of genes encoding superantigens explains why s aureus is capable of infecting humans of diverse genetic backgrounds eliciting severe immune reactions investigation of many newly identified gene products including the 70 putative virulence factors will greatly improve our understanding of the biology of staphylococci and the processes of infectious diseases caused by s aureus
E,shrews of the genus sorex are characterized by a holarctic distribution and relationships among extant taxa have never been fully resolved phylogenies have been proposed based on morphological karyological and biochemical comparisons but these analyses often produced controversial and contradictory results phylogenetic analyses of partial mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences 1011 bp were used to examine the relationships among 27 sorex species the molecular data suggest that sorex comprises two major monophyletic lineages one restricted mostly to the new world and one with a primarily palearctic distribution furthermore several sister-species relationships are revealed by the analysis based on the split between the soricinae and crocidurinae subfamilies we used a 95 confidence interval for both the calibration of a molecular clock and the subsequent calculation of major diversification events within the genus sorex our analysis does not support an unambiguous acceleration of the molecular clock in shrews the estimated rate being similar to other estimates of mammalian mitochondrial clocks in addition the data presented here indicate that estimates from the fossil record greatly underestimate divergence dates among sorex taxa
E,the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase odc ec 41117 catalyses the first and rate-limiting step in polyamine biosynthesis its activity is markedly increased in rapidly growing or regenerating tissue and is subject to regulation by a variety of trophic and mitogenic stimuli odc is therefore believed to play an essential role in the onset of cellular proliferation in a molecular-biological approach to investigate odc regulation upon induction by tumor promoters in rat liver we isolated an almost full-length rat odc cdna clone of 24 kb designated podce10 from a cdna library of testosterone-induced rat kidney polya rna characterization by restriction-endonuclease mapping and sequence analysis showed strong homology to mouse odc cdna sequences previously published gupta and coffino j biol chem 260 1985 2941-2944 kahana and nathans proc natl acad sci usa 82 1985 1673-1677 hickok et al proc natl acad sci usa 83 1986 594-598 this homology is most pronounced in the 461-aa-spanning coding region amounting to 94 and 97 at the dna and protein levels respectively in the 423-nt 5' leader the rat-mouse homology approx 75 is most pronounced in a region of about 175 nt directly upstream from the translational start site the leader sequence also contains a perfect inverted repeat of 54 nt and ten additional upstream atg triplets which are all followed by nonsense codons before the initiating atg in the 633-nt 3' trailer region of podce10 an additional polyadenylation signal is observed more than 300 nt upstream from the 3' end rat-mouse homology is about 80 up to this first polyadenylation signal and is considerably less thereafter the presence of two alternate polyadenylation sites most likely accounts for the 3' size heterogeneity observed in the two odc mrnas of 21 and 26 kb respectively in rat liver both mrnas are coordinately induced by different tumor promoters finally southern blot analysis of normal rat liver and rat hepatoma dna revealed that rat odc as in other rodents belongs to a multigene family
E,the fly drosophila melanogaster is one of the most intensively studied organisms in biology and serves as a model system for the investigation of many developmental and cellular processes common to higher eukaryotes including humans we have determined the nucleotide sequence of nearly all of the approximately 120-megabase euchromatic portion of the drosophila genome using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy supported by extensive clone-based sequence and a high-quality bacterial artificial chromosome physical map efforts are under way to close the remaining gaps however the sequence is of sufficient accuracy and contiguity to be declared substantially complete and to support an initial analysis of genome structure and preliminary gene annotation and interpretation the genome encodes approximately 13600 genes somewhat fewer than the smaller caenorhabditis elegans genome but with comparable functional diversity
E,the genes encoding cytochrome b6 of the chloroplast cytochrome b6f complex petb and the atp synthase cf1-beta subunit atpb and epsilon-subunit atpe were identified on the ecod fragment of the euglena gracilis chloroplast genome the complete nucleotide sequence of these three genes was determined the petb-atpb-atpe genes are cotranscribed as a tricistronic operon this gene organization differs from that of land plants in which atpb-atpe form a discistronic operon and petb is within the psbb-ycf8-psbh-petb-petd operon euglena cytochrome b6 and the beta-subunit of the chloroplast atp synthase are very similar in derived amino acid sequence to the corresponding gene products from other organisms the epsilon-subunit of the chloroplast atp synthase complex is more divergent in euglena the petb-atpb-atpe genes contain introns including two twintrons at eight different positions all of the intron positions were confirmed by analysis of cdnas two independent intercistronic rna processing events and 11 splicing reactions lead to the accumulation of the mature petb atpb and atpe monocistronic mrnas
B,bifidobacteria are gram-positive prokaryotes that naturally colonize the human gastrointestinal tract git and vagina although not numerically dominant in the complex intestinal microflora they are considered as key commensals that promote a healthy git we determined the 226-mb genome sequence of an infant-derived strain of bifidobacterium longum and identified 1730 possible coding sequences organized in a 60-gc circular chromosome bioinformatic analysis revealed several physiological traits that could partially explain the successful adaptation of this bacteria to the colon an unexpectedly large number of the predicted proteins appeared to be specialized for catabolism of a variety of oligosaccharides some possibly released by rare or novel glycosyl hydrolases acting on nondigestible plant polymers or host-derived glycoproteins and glycoconjugates this ability to scavenge from a large variety of nutrients likely contributes to the competitiveness and persistence of bifidobacteria in the colon many genes for oligosaccharide metabolism were found in self-regulated modules that appear to have arisen in part from gene duplication or horizontal acquisition complete pathways for all amino acids nucleotides and some key vitamins were identified however routes for asp and cys were atypical more importantly genome analysis provided insights into the reciprocal interactions of bifidobacteria with their hosts we identified polypeptides that showed homology to most major proteins needed for production of glycoprotein-binding fimbriae structures that could possibly be important for adhesion and persistence in the git we also found a eukaryotic-type serine protease inhibitor serpin possibly involved in the reported immunomodulatory activity of bifidobacteria
B,the most abundant carbon source transported into legume root nodules is photosynthetically produced sucrose yet the importance of its metabolism by rhizobia in planta is not yet known to identify genes involved in sucrose uptake and hydrolysis we screened a sinorhizobium meliloti genomic library and discovered a segment of s meliloti dna which allows ralstonia eutropha to grow on the alpha-glucosides sucrose maltose and trehalose tn5 mutagenesis localized the required genes to a 68-kb region containing five open reading frames which were named agl for alpha-glucoside utilization four of these agle aglf aglg and aglk appear to encode a periplasmic-binding-protein-dependent sugar transport system and one agla appears to encode an alpha-glucosidase with homology to family 13 of glycosyl hydrolases cosmid-borne agl genes permit uptake of radiolabeled sucrose into r eutropha cells analysis of the properties of agl mutants suggests that s meliloti possesses at least one additional alpha-glucosidase as well as a lower-affinity transport system for alpha-glucosides it is possible that the fix phenotype of agl mutants on alfalfa is due to these additional functions loci found by dna sequencing to be adjacent to aglefgak include a probable regulatory gene aglr zwf and edd which encode the first two enzymes of the entner-doudoroff pathway pgl which shows homology to a gene encoding a putative phosphogluconolactonase and a novel rhizobium-specific repeat element
B,streptococcus pyogenes group a streptococcus cell extracts ce have a remarkably powerful and dose-dependent inhibitory effect on antigen superantigen or mitogen-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cell pbmc proliferation in vitro purification of the inhibitory component present in s pyogenes type m5 manfredo strain ce by anion-exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography showed that the inhibitor had an approximate native molecular mass of 100 kda sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified inhibitory fractions followed by silver staining gave a single band with an approximate molecular mass of 47 kda indicating that the inhibitor is composed of two identical subunits nh2-terminal sequencing of the protein revealed that it was identical to the previously characterized streptococcal acid glycoprotein sagp this protein possesses between 315 and 390 amino acid identity with arginine deiminase ad from mycoplasma hominis mycoplasma arginini pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas aeruginosa ad enzyme activity was present in unfractionated ce prepared from a range of streptococcal strains and partially purified inhibitory fractions of manfredo ce also had high levels of activity the inhibitory effect of manfredo ce was overcome by the addition of l-arginine to proliferation assays in which human pbmc were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin we conclude that sagp or its homolog possesses ad activity and that the potent inhibition of proliferation of human t cells by streptococcal ce is due to activity of this enzyme
B,the gene coding for four subunits of cytochrome aa3-type oxidase was isolated from a genomic dna library of the thermophilic bacterium ps3 and sequenced the n-terminus of each subunit was also sequenced to verify the initiation site of the reading frame the deduced amino acid sequences contained 615 amino acid residues for subunit i co1caab product 333 residues for subunit ii co2caaa product 207 residues for subunit iii co3caac product and 109 residues for subunit iv co4caad product after processing re-examination of the sequencing of caa revealed a longer open reading frame for co1 which contains 14 transmembrane segments instead of 12 sone et al 1988 j biochem 103 606-610 although the main portions of the sequences constituting cytochrome a fea cytochrome a3 feb and cub are correct ps3 co2 has an additional sequence for cytochrome c after the cua binding protein portion with 2 transmembrane segments which is homologous to the mitochondrial counterpart ps3 co3 has dccd-binding glutamyl residues but contains only 5 transmembrane segments unlike the mitochondrial counterpart which has 7 segments the subunits of ps3 cytochrome oxidase aa3-type show clear similarity in amino acid sequences with those of cytochrome bo-type oxidase from escherichia coli as well in spite of the difference of hemes ps3 co3 and co4 are much more similar to e coli co3 and co4 than to mitochondrial co3 and co4 respectively
V,pvc-211 murine leukemia virus mulv is a replication-competent ecotropic type c retrovirus that was isolated after passage of the friend virus complex through f344 rats unlike viruses in the friend virus complex it does not cause erythroleukemia but causes a rapidly progressive hind limb paralysis when injected into newborn rats and mice we have isolated an infectious dna clone clone 3d of this virus which causes neurological disease in animals as efficiently as parental pvc-211 mulv the restriction map of clone 3d is very similar to that of the nonneuropathogenic erythroleukemogenic friend murine leukemia virus f-mulv suggesting that pvc-211 mulv is a variant of f-mulv and that no major structural alteration was involved in its derivation studies with chimeric viruses between pvc-211 mulv clone 3d and wild-type f-mulv clone 57 indicate that at least one determinant for neuropathogenicity resides in the 21-kb xbai-clai fragment containing the gp70 coding region of pvc-211 mulv compared with nonneuropathogenic ecotropic mulvs the env gene of pvc-211 mulv encodes four unique amino acids in the gp70 protein nucleotide sequence analysis also revealed a deletion in the u3 region of the long terminal repeat ltr of pvc-211 mulv clone 3d compared with f-mulv clone 57 in contrast to the env gene of pvc-211 mulv particular sequences within the u3 region of the viral ltr do not appear to be required for neuropathogenicity however the changes in the ltr of pvc-211 mulv may be responsible for the failure of this virus to cause erythroleukemia because chimeric viruses containing the u3 region of f-mulv clone 57 were erythroleukemogenic whereas those with the u3 of pvc-211 mulv clone 3d were not
B,pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that is one of the top three causes of opportunistic human infections a major factor in its prominence as a pathogen is its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants here we report the complete sequence of p aeruginosa strain pao1 at 63 million base pairs this is the largest bacterial genome sequenced and the sequence provides insights into the basis of the versatility and intrinsic drug resistance of p aeruginosa consistent with its larger genome size and environmental adaptability p aeruginosa contains the highest proportion of regulatory genes observed for a bacterial genome and a large number of genes involved in the catabolism transport and efflux of organic compounds as well as four potential chemotaxis systems we propose that the size and complexity of the p aeruginosa genome reflect an evolutionary adaptation permitting it to thrive in diverse environments and resist the effects of a variety of antimicrobial substances
E,two isolates of candida glabrata one susceptible and one resistant to azole antifungals were previously shown to differ in quantity and activity of the cytochrome p-450 14alpha-lanosterol demethylase which is the target for azole antifungals the resistant isolate also had a lower intracellular level of fluconazole but not of ketoconazole or itraconazole than the susceptible isolate in the present study a 37-fold increase in the copy number of the cyp51 gene encoding the 14alpha-lanosterol demethylase was found the amount of cyp51 mrna transcript in the resistant isolate was eight times greater than it was in the susceptible isolate hybridization experiments on chromosomal blots indicated that this increase in copy number was due to duplication of the entire chromosome containing the cyp51 gene the phenotypic instability of the resistant isolate was demonstrated genotypically a gradual loss of the duplicated chromosome was seen in successive subcultures of the isolate in fluconazole-free medium and correlated with reversion to susceptibility the greater abundance of the amplified chromosome induced pronounced differences in the protein patterns of the susceptible and revertant isolates versus that of the resistant isolate as demonstrated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis 2d-ge densitometry of the 2d-ge product indicated upregulation of at least 25 proteins and downregulation of at least 76 proteins in the resistant isolate
E,quinolinate quinolinic acid is a potent endogenous excitotoxin of neuronal cells elevation of quinolinate levels in the brain has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders the so-called quinolinate hypothesis quinolinate is non-enzymatically derived from alpha-amino-beta-carboxymuconate-epsilon-semialdehyde acms alpha-amino-beta-carboxymuconate-epsilon-semialdehyde decarboxylase acmsd is the only known enzyme that can process acms to a benign catabolite and thus prevent the accumulation of quinolinate from acms acmsd seems to be regulated by nutritional and hormonal signals but its molecular mechanism has to date been largely unknown utilizing partial amino acid sequences obtained from highly purified porcine kidney acmsd a cdna encoding human acmsd was cloned and characterized the cdna encodes a unique open reading frame of 336 amino acids and displays little homology to any known enzymes or motifs in mammalian databases suggesting that acmsd may contain a new kind of protein fold real-time pcr-based quantification of acmsd revealed very low but significant levels of the expression in the brain brain acmsd messages were down- and up-regulated in response to low protein diet and streptozocin-induced diabetes respectively the enzyme activities measured from partially purified brains were closely correlated with the changes in the message levels expression of quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase qprt another enzyme that catabolizes quinolinate was also found in the brain this suggests that a pathway does exist by which the levels of quinolinate in the brain are regulated in this report we address the molecular basis underlying quinolinate metabolism and the regulation of acmsd expression
B,the complete genomic sequence of corynebacterium glutamicum atcc 13032 well-known in industry for the production of amino acids eg of l-glutamate and l-lysine was determined the c glutamicum genome was found to consist of a single circular chromosome comprising 3282708 base pairs several dna regions of unusual composition were identified that were potentially acquired by horizontal gene transfer eg a segment of dna from c diphtheriae and a prophage-containing region after automated and manual annotation 3002 protein-coding genes have been identified and to 2489 of these functions were assigned by homologies to known proteins these analyses confirm the taxonomic position of c glutamicum as related to mycobacteria and show a broad metabolic diversity as expected for a bacterium living in the soil as an example for biotechnological application the complete genome sequence was used to reconstruct the metabolic flow of carbon into a number of industrially important products derived from the amino acid l-aspartate
B,branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase is a multienzyme complex which is required for the metabolism of the branched-chain amino acids in pseudomonas putida the structural genes encoding all four proteins of the bkd operon have been cloned and their nucleotide sequences have been determined g burns k t madhusudhan k hatter and j r sokatch p 177-184 in s silver a m chakrabarty b iglewski and s kaplan ed pseudomonas biotransformations pathogenesis and evolving biotechnology american society for microbiology washington dc 1990 an open reading frame which encoded a protein with 365 amino acid identity to the leucine-responsive regulatory protein lrp of escherichia coli was found immediately upstream of the bkd operon chromosomal mutations affecting this gene named bkdr resulted in a loss of ability to use branched-chain amino acids as carbon and energy sources and failure to produce branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase these mutations were complemented in trans by plasmids which contained intact bkdr mutations affecting bkdr did not have any effect on transport of branched-chain amino acids or transamination therefore the bkdr gene product must affect expression of the bkd operon and regulation must be positive mutations affecting bkdr could also be complemented by plasmids containing lrp of e coli this is the first instance of a lrp-like protein demonstrated to regulate expression of an operon outside of e coli
A,the hsp70dnak locus of the moderate thermophilic archaeon methanosarcina thermophila tm-1 was cloned sequenced and tested in vitro to measure gene induction by heat and ammonia ie stressors pertinent to the biotechnological ecosystem of this methanogen that plays a key role in anaerobic bioconversions the locus' genes and organization 5'-grpe-hsp70dnak-hsp40 dnaj-trka-3' are the same as those of the closely related mesophile methanosarcina mazei s-6 but different from those of the only other archaeon for which comparable sequence data exist the thermophile methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum deltah from another genus in which trka is not part of the locus the proteins encoded in the tm-1 genes are very similar to the s-6 homologs but considerably less similar to the deltah proteins the tm-1 hsp70dnak protein has the 23-amino acid deletion--by comparison with homologs from gram-negative bacteria first described in the s-6 molecule and later found to be present in all homologs from archaea and gram positives the genes responded to a temperature elevation in a manner that demonstrated that they are heat-shock genes functionally active in vivo ammonia also induced a heat-shock type of response by hsp70dnak and a similar response by trka the data suggest that the moderate thermophile tm-1 has an active hsp70dnak-chaperone machine in contrast to hyperthermophilic archaea and that trka is a stress gene inasmuch as it responds like classic heat-shock genes to stressors that induce a typical heat-shock response
E,the cdna encoding rat brain cytosolic acyl-coa thioester hydrolase act has been cloned and sequenced and the primary structure of the enzyme has been deduced a partial amino acid sequence 38 amino acids of the enzyme was determined using the peptides generated after cnbr digestion of the purified enzyme primers synthesized on the basis of this information were used to isolate two cdna clones each encoding the full length of the enzyme the nucleotide sequences of these clones contained an open reading frame encoding a 358-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 397 kda similar to that determined for the purified enzyme 409 kda the deduced act sequence showed no homology to the known sequences of any other thioesterases nor to any other known protein sequence however there was a strong homology to a number of expressed sequence tag human brain cdna clones the identity of the act cdna was confirmed by the expression of act activity in escherichia coli there was a 10-15-fold increase in act-specific activity in the bacterial extracts after induction with isopropyl thiogalactoside and the properties of the expressed enzyme fusion protein were the same as those of the purified rat brain act northern blot analysis showed that a 165-kilobase act transcript was present in rat brain and testis but not in any other rat tissues examined however the act mrna was induced in the liver of rats that were fed wy-14643 a peroxisome proliferator and inducer of rodent liver cytosolic acyl-coa thioesterase these results indicate that the induced rat liver act is homologous to the constitutive rat brain act
B,two motility genes flih and flii of the lyme disease spirochete borrelia burgdorferi were cloned physically mapped and sequenced flih and flii showed extensive homology to the proteins involved in the export of flagellar components and to virulence factors found in both animal and plant bacterial pathogens the results suggest that the flagellar apparatus and associated protein export pathway are well conserved in evolution
E,a rat adp-ribosylation factorarf-like protein named arl184 was identified by cdna cloning the corresponding recombinant protein had an apparent molecular mass of 22000 the deduced amino acid sequence had 55 identity with the human arl1 and four functional gtp-binding sites immunofluorescent confocal microscopy studies showed that arl184 was present in the cytosol as well as in the golgi apparatus raising the possibility that it has a role in a secretory pathway the involvement of this arf-like protein in secretion was confirmed by demonstrating that arl184 potentiated acetylcholine release in stably transfected pc12 cells collectively these results suggest that this arl protein is a component of a regulated secretory pathway involved in ca2-dependent release of acetylcholine
E,the entire dna sequence of chromosome iii of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae has been determined this is the first complete sequence analysis of an entire chromosome from any organism the 315-kilobase sequence reveals 182 open reading frames for proteins longer than 100 amino acids of which 37 correspond to known genes and 29 more show some similarity to sequences in databases of 55 new open reading frames analysed by gene disruption three are essential genes of 42 non-essential genes that were tested 14 show some discernible effect on phenotype and the remaining 28 have no overt function
E,fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy fcmd one of the most common autosomal recessive disorders in japan incidence is 07-12 per 10000 births is characterized by congenital muscular dystrophy associated with brain malformation micropolygria due to a defect in the migration of neurons we previously mapped the fcmd gene to a region of less than 100 kilobases which included the marker locus d9s2107 on chromosome 9q31 we have also described a haplotype that is shared by more than 80 of fcmd chromosomes indicating that most chromosomes bearing the fcmd mutation could be derived from a single ancestor here we report that there is a retrotransposal insertion of tandemly repeated sequences within this candidate-gene interval in all fcmd chromosomes carrying the founder haplotype 87 the inserted sequence is about 3 kilobases long and is located in the 3' untranslated region of a gene encoding a new 461-amino-acid protein this gene is expressed in various tissues in normal individuals but not in fcmd patients who carry the insertion two independent point mutations confirm that mutation of this gene is responsible for fcmd the predicted protein which we term fukutin contains an amino-terminal signal sequence which together with results from transfection experiments suggests that fukutin is a secreted protein to our knowledge fcmd is the first human disease to be caused by an ancient retrotransposal integration
B,chromobacterium violaceum is one of millions of species of free-living microorganisms that populate the soil and water in the extant areas of tropical biodiversity around the world its complete genome sequence reveals i extensive alternative pathways for energy generation ii approximately 500 orfs for transport-related proteins iii complex and extensive systems for stress adaptation and motility and iv widespread utilization of quorum sensing for control of inducible systems all of which underpin the versatility and adaptability of the organism the genome also contains extensive but incomplete arrays of orfs coding for proteins associated with mammalian pathogenicity possibly involved in the occasional but often fatal cases of human c violaceum infection there is in addition a series of previously unknown but important enzymes and secondary metabolites including paraquat-inducible proteins drug and heavy-metal-resistance proteins multiple chitinases and proteins for the detoxification of xenobiotics that may have biotechnological applications
E,the human gastric h  k-atpase gene 15 kilobases was cloned and its nucleotide sequence was determined the gene has 22 exons and codes a protein of 1035 residues including the initiator methionine mr  114047 a conserved lysine-rich sequence with inserted glycine residues was found near the amino terminus of the enzyme the phosphorylation site and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-binding residues found in the rat and pig enzymes are also conserved in the human enzyme the positions of introns in the human h  k-atpase gene are essentially the same as those in the human na  k-atpase alpha and alpha iii subunits but the first introns of the two enzymes are difficult to align and unlike in the na  k-atpase gene the sixth exon in the h  k-atpase gene is not separated by an intron furthermore the ninth intron is located two bases upstream of the position for the corresponding intron of the na  k-atpase alpha iii subunit the similarity in organization of these two atpase genes and the homology in the primary structures of their proteins approximately 60 suggest that these two genes were derived from a common ancestral gene however the 5'-flanking regions of the genes for h  k-atpase and the na  k-atpase alpha  subunit show no apparent sequence homology indicating that their transcriptions are regulated differently the control region of the fast-twitch sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2-atpase gene also showed no sequence homology to that of h  k-atpase the 5'-flanking region of the h  k-atpase gene contains potential binding sites for rna polymerase ii and various transcriptional regulation factors and several direct and inverted repeat sequences which may be important for specific and controlled expression of the gene in gastric parietal cells there are two polyadenylation signals in the 3'-flanking region of the h  k-atpase gene but the sequence of this region shows no homology to those of the corresponding regions of the genes for the na  k-atpase alpha and alpha iii subunits
E,a recently discovered class of genes in arabidopsis thaliana encode putative transcription factors which contain a homeodomain closely linked to a leucine zipper motif we have previously reported on the cloning and cdna sequence of one gene of this class athb-3 in this article we show this gene to be expressed predominantly in the cortex of the root and the stem using the athb-3 clone as a probe we have isolated cdna clones corresponding to three novel homeodomain-leucine zipper proteins these clones athb-5 athb-6 and athb-7 hybridized to transcripts that were relatively abundant in the leaf but also present in other vegetative organs as well as in the flower only weak hybridization was observed to seed pod samples these observations indicate that these athb genes have major functions in the mature plant and therefore in contrast to homeobox genes in other eukaryotes and to the kn-1 gene in maize are unlikely to function in the primary control of developmental processes during embryogenesis or organogenesis the deduced amino acid sequences of athb-5 athb-6 and athb-7 are highly similar to the previously isolated athb-1 athb-2 and athb-3 in the homeodomain and leucine-zipper parts of the proteins whereas the similarities to homeodomain proteins from other eukaryotes are limited the athb proteins thus constitute a new and well defined class of homeodomain proteins apparently unique to plants
B,nucleotide sequences of the cysk regions of salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli have been determined a total of 3812 and 2595 nucleotides were sequenced from s typhimurium and e coli respectively open reading frames of 323 codons were found in both species and were identified as those of cysk by comparison of deduced amino acid sequences with amino- and carboxyl-terminal amino acid analyses of the s typhimurium cysk gene product o-acetylserine thiol-lyase a the two cysk dna sequences were 85 identical and the deduced amino acid sequences were 96 identical the major transcription initiation sites for cysk were found to be virtually identical in the two organisms by using primer extension and s1 nuclease protection techniques the -35 region corresponding to the major transcription start site was ttcccc in s typhimurium and ttccgc in e coli the deviation of these sequences from the consensus sequence ttgaca may reflect the fact that cysk is subject to positive control and requires the cysb regulatory protein for expression sequences downstream of cysk were found to include ptsh and a portion of ptsi thus establishing the exact relationship of cysk with these two genes a 290-codon open reading frame which may represent the cysz gene was identified upstream of cysk
E,we report the sequence of a human cdna encoding a protein homologous to devb a bacterial gene often found in proximity to the gene encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in bacterial genomes and to the c-terminal part of human hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase the protein was expressed in escherichia coli purified and shown to be 6-phosphogluconolactonase the enzyme catalyzing the second step of the pentose phosphate pathway sequence analysis indicates that bacterial devb proteins the c-terminal part of hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and yeast sol1-4 proteins are most likely also 6-phosphogluconolactonases and that these proteins are related to glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerases
B,we have purified and characterized two ferredoxins designated fd-1 and fd-2 from the soluble protein fraction of sulfonylurea herbicide induced streptomyces griseolus these cells have previously been shown to contain two inducible cytochromes p-450 p-450su1 cyp105a1 and p-450su2 cyp105b1 responsible for herbicide metabolism o'keefe d p romesser j a 38 leto k j 1988 arch microbiol 149 406-412 although fd-2 is more effective either ferredoxin can restore sulfonylurea monooxygenase activity to an aerobic mixture of nadph spinach ferredoxinnadp oxidoreductase purified cytochrome p-450su1 and herbicide substrate the gene for fd-1 is located in the genome just downstream of the gene for cytochrome p-450su1 the gene for fd-2 follows the gene for p-450su2 the deduced amino acid sequences of the two ferredoxins show that if monomeric each has a molecular mass of approximately 7 kda and alignment of the two sequences demonstrates that they are approximately 52 positionally identical the spectroscopic properties and iron and acid-labile sulfide contents of both ferredoxins suggest that as isolated each contains a single 3fe-4s cluster the presence of only three cysteines in fd-1 and comparisons with three 4fe-4s ferredoxins with high sequence similarity suggest that both fd-1 and fd-2 have an alanine in the position where these 4fe-4s proteins have a fourth cysteine ligand to the cluster transformation of streptomyces lividans a strain unable to metabolize sulfonylureas with dna encoding both p-450su1 and fd-1 results in cells capable of herbicide metabolism s lividans transformants encoding only cytochrome p-450su1 do not metabolize herbicideabstract truncated at 250 words
E,calcitonin gene-related peptide has been extracted from the skin exudate of a single living specimen of the frog phyllomedusa bicolor and purified to homogeneity by a two-step protocol a total volume of 250 microl of exudate yielded 380 microg of purified peptide mass spectrometric analysis and gas phase sequencing of the purified peptide as well as chemical synthesis and cdna analysis were consistent with the structure scdtstcatqrladflsrsggigspdfvptdvsansf amide and the presence of a disulfide bridge linking cys2 and cys7 the skin peptide named skin calcitonin gene-related peptide differs significantly from all other members of the calcitonin gene-related peptide family of peptides at nine positions but binds with high affinity to calcitonin gene-related peptide receptors in the rat brain and acts as an agonist in the rat vas deferens bioassay with potencies equal to those of human cgrp reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction coupled with cdna cloning and sequencing demonstrated that skin calcitonin gene-related peptide isolated in the skin is identical to that present in the frog's central and enteric nervous systems these data which indicate for the first time the existence of calcitonin gene-related peptide in the frog skin add further support to the brain-skin-gut triangle hypothesis as a useful tool in the identification andor isolation of mammalian peptides that are present in the brain and other tissues in only minute quantities
E,the neu oncogene is repeatedly activated in neuro- and glioblastomas derived by transplacental mutagenesis of the bdix strain of rat with ethylnitrosourea foci induced by the dnas from such tumours on nih 3t3 cells contain the neu oncogene and an associated phosphoprotein of relative molecular mass 185000 p185 previous work has shown that the neu gene is related to but distinct from the gene encoding the egf receptor c-erb-b here we describe a neu complementary dna clone isolated from a cell line transformed by this oncogene the clone has biological activity in a focus-forming assay the nucleotide sequence of this clone predicts a 1260-amino-acid transmembrane protein product similar in overall structure to the egf receptor we found that 50 of the predicted amino acids of neu and the egf receptor are identical greater than 80 of the amino acids in the tyrosine kinase domain are identical our results suggest strongly that the neu gene encodes the receptor for an as yet unidentified growth factor
E,we have isolated a leishmania mexicana homologue of the fission yeast suc1 gene using pcr with oligonucleotides designed to conserved regions of cdc2 kinase subunits cks the product of cks1 is a 12 kda polypeptide which has 70 identity with human p9cks1 and 44 identity with fission yeast p13suc1p12cks1 was detected in the three life-cycle stages of l mexicana by immunoblotting recombinant p12cks1 p12cks1his bound to agarose beads was used as a matrix to affinity-select histone h1 kinase complexes from leishmania yeast and bovine extracts immunoblotting showed that yeast and bovine cdc2 kinase bound to p12cks1his thus demonstrating functional homology between l mexicana p12cks1 and yeast p13suc1 histone h1 kinase activity was found at a high level in the proliferative promastigote and amastigote forms of l mexicana but at a low level in the non-dividing metacyclic form these activities are likely to be the same as the leishmanial p13suc1 binding kinase sbcrk described previously mottram kinnaird shiels tait and barry 1993 j biol chem 268 21044-21051 a distinct cdc2-related kinase l mexicana crk1 was also found to associate with p12cks1his but affinity-depletion experiments showed that crk1 was not responsible for the histone h1 kinase activity associating with p12cks1his in promastigote cell extracts the finding that p12cks1 associates with at least two cdc2-related kinases sbcrk and crk1 is consistent with the presence of a large gene family of cdc2-related kinases in trypanosomatids a situation thought to be more similar to higher eukaryotes than yeast
B,the arol gene encoding the enzyme shikimate kinase ii was cloned from escherichia coli k12 construction of over-expressing strains permitted for the first time the purification to homogeneity of a monofunctional shikimate kinase the complete amino acid sequence of shikimate kinase ii was determined by a combined nucleotide and direct amino acid sequencing strategy e coli shikimate kinase ii is a monomeric enzyme containing 173 amino acid residues with a calculated mr 18937 the amino acid sequence contains a region homologous with other kinases and atp-requiring enzymes evidence is presented suggesting that the transcriptional start site of the arol gene is located within a potential operator site
A,the complete 1751377-bp sequence of the genome of the thermophilic archaeon methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum deltah has been determined by a whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach a total of 1855 open reading frames orfs have been identified that appear to encode polypeptides 844 46 of which have been assigned putative functions based on their similarities to database sequences with assigned functions a total of 514 28 of the orf-encoded polypeptides are related to sequences with unknown functions and 496 27 have little or no homology to sequences in public databases comparisons with eucarya- bacteria- and archaea-specific databases reveal that 1013 of the putative gene products 54 are most similar to polypeptide sequences described previously for other organisms in the domain archaea comparisons with the methanococcus jannaschii genome data underline the extensive divergence that has occurred between these two methanogens only 352 19 of m thermoautotrophicum orfs encode sequences that are 50 identical to m jannaschii polypeptides and there is little conservation in the relative locations of orthologous genes when the m thermoautotrophicum orfs are compared to sequences from only the eucaryal and bacterial domains 786 42 are more similar to bacterial sequences and 241 13 are more similar to eucaryal sequences the bacterial domain-like gene products include the majority of those predicted to be involved in cofactor and small molecule biosyntheses intermediary metabolism transport nitrogen fixation regulatory functions and interactions with the environment most proteins predicted to be involved in dna metabolism transcription and translation are more similar to eucaryal sequences gene structure and organization have features that are typical of the bacteria including genes that encode polypeptides closely related to eucaryal proteins there are 24 polypeptides that could form two-component sensor kinase-response regulator systems and homologs of the bacterial hsp70-response proteins dnak and dnaj which are notably absent in m jannaschii dna replication initiation and chromosome packaging in m thermoautotrophicum are predicted to have eucaryal features based on the presence of two cdc6 homologs and three histones however the presence of an ftsz gene indicates a bacterial type of cell division initiation the dna polymerases include an x-family repair type and an unusual archaeal b type formed by two separate polypeptides the dna-dependent rna polymerase rnap subunits a' a b' b and h are encoded in a typical archaeal rnap operon although a second a' subunit-encoding gene is present at a remote location there are two rrna operons and 39 trna genes are dispersed around the genome although most of these occur in clusters three of the trna genes have introns including the trnapro ggg gene which contains a second intron at an unprecedented location there is no selenocysteinyl-trna gene nor evidence for classically organized is elements prophages or plasmids the genome contains one intein and two extended repeats 36 and 86 kb that are members of a family with 18 representatives in the m jannaschii genome
B,a 125-kilobase segment of bacillus subtilis chromosomal dna containing the entire pyrimidine biosynthetic pyr gene cluster has been cloned and sequenced the sequenced dna has seven cistrons encoding the six enzymes of de novo pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis and two open reading frames of unknown function based on the sequence and mapping of transcripts the genes in this cluster appear to be transcribed on one large polycistronic message in the order orf1 pyrb pyrc pyraa pyrab orf2 pyrd pyrf pyre the deduced amino acid sequences for six pyrimidine biosynthetic enzymes from b subtilis and comparisons with the corresponding sequences from numerous other species are presented the 3' ends of the reading frames overlap the 5' ends of the downstream open reading frames for all cistrons in the cluster except orf1 and pyrb which are separated by a 145-base pair intercistronic region the start of transcription was mapped by primer extension to a g residue 158 nucleotides upstream from the translation initiation codon of orf1 this site is preceded by a typical b subtilis sigma a-dependent promoter a promoter indicator plasmid was used to show that this region carried a promoter from which transcription was regulated by pyrimidines transcription from this promoter was not detected in primer extension experiments using mrna prepared from b subtilis cells grown in the presence of excess uracil no transcripts initiating from the intercistronic space between orf1 and pyrb were detected with s1 nuclease mapping however a transcription terminator was detected in this region that reduced but did not fully block transcriptional readthrough this terminator was not regulated by pyrimidines in the growth medium under the conditions tested the region immediately following the promoter and 5' to orf1 has a potential transcription terminator sequence the roles if any of these transcription terminators in the regulation of pyr operon expression are yet to be determined however deletion of the terminator immediately following the promoter abolished pyrimidine regulation of transcription in the indicator plasmid
E,various hla-b molecules exhibit serologic cross-reactions with hla-b7 including hla-b27 b40 bw42 and bw22 of this group primary structures for the three serologic subdivisions of hla-bw22 hla-bw54 bw55 and bw56 have yet to be determined here we describe the nucleotide sequences of five distinctive hla-bw22 alleles isolated from cells of different ethnic origins typed either for bw54 bw55 or bw56 heterogeneity in molecules typed as bw55 and bw56 was defined the five hla-bw22 alleles form a closely related family that appears to have evolved by a series of simple gene conversion events all of which alter the antigen recognition site of the encoded proteins of note hla-bw54 is the product of a gene conversion between hla-b and c alleles all the bw22 alleles encode an alpha 1-helix identical in amino acid sequence to that of hla-b7 and bw42 a feature almost certainly responsible for the serologic cross-reactivity of these molecules shared substitutions in the alpha 1-helix can also explain the cross-reactivity of bw22 and b7 with b27 patterns of amino acid substitution in the alpha 2-domain of bw22 heavy chains correlate with certain antibody and t cell cross-reactivities thereby implicating particular amino acids in their target epitopes
E,blue light induces various physiological morphological and biochemical reactions in the filamentous fungus neurospora crassa this light response is accompanied by a global change in gene expression and several light-inducible transcripts bli-genes have been cloned we isolated the genomic clone of the gene bli-3 whose mrna we have previously shown to be induced 2 minutes after the beginning of illumination its dna sequence predicted a transcriptional unit of 1050 bp encoding a novel hydrophilic protein of 209 aminoacids comparison to other n crassa genes revealed a group of inducible genes which share this promoter structure a well conserved tata-box similar transcription start box tcatcanc and repeats of pyrimidines ct between these boxes based upon this group we propose a consensus sequence for one possible type of inducible promoter in n crassa
E,aromatase cytochrome p-450 aro is the major enzyme of estrogen biosynthesis the aim of the present investigation was the isolation and comparative sequence analysis of the bovine aromatase cytochrome p-450 transcript bcyp19 from a placental lambda gt10 cdna library from three overlapping clones a total sequence of 5180 bp could be derived including two polyadenylation sites and signals located next to each other as found in other species the open reading frame orf comprises 1509 bp and shows 87 78 and 78 sequence homology to the coding areas of the human rat and mouse genes respectively the 3'-untranslated region utr of the bovine transcript is about 2-kb longer than that of the human gene hcyp19 it contains homologous retroposon elements of the bovidae dimer family bdf at two different positions and ends with a sequence motif which also occurs repeatedly within the bovine genome the 5'-utr isolated from placenta includes a new sequence upstream from exon ii that was not found in cattle or other species so far we conclude from our data that i as found in other species bcyp19 is likely to be transcribed into different mrna species ii the bovine 3'-utr was the target for multiple insertions of repeated sequence motifs iii the unusual length of the bcyp19 transcript is mainly due to the long 3'-utr iv it includes sequences which are found in humans only on the genomic level conceivably due to mutational inactivation of a primordial polyadenylation signal pas and v the recently used functional pas is contributed by a downstream bovine repeat element
E,a full-length genomic dna fragment that codes for a novel ef-hand protein dictyostelium discoideum was cloned and sequenced the protein is composed of 168 amino acids and contains four consensus sequences that are typical for ca2-binding ef-hand domains the protein sequence exhibits only minor similarities to other calmodulin-type proteins from dictyostelium the genomic dna harbors two short introns their positions suggest that the gene is unrelated to the ef-hand proteins from the calmodulin group northern blot analysis showed that the mrna level was significantly increased during development polyclonal antibodies raised against the recombinant protein recognized in western blots a protein of about 20 kda like the mrna also the protein was more abundant in developing cells overlay experiments with 45ca2 indicated that the ef-hands in fact have ca2-binding activity the recent description of cbp1 another calmodulin-type dictyostelium protein that is upregulated during development coukell et al 1995 febs lett 362 342-346 suggests that d discoideum contains a family of ef-hand proteins that have specific functions during distinct steps of development we therefore designate the protein described in this report as cbp2
B,a 10-kb region of the bacillus subtilis genome that contains genes involved in biotin-biosynthesis was cloned and sequenced dna sequence analysis indicated that b subtilis contains homologs of the escherichia coli and bacillus sphaericus bioa biob biod and biof genes these four genes and a homolog of the b sphaericus biow gene are arranged in a single operon in the order biowafdr and are followed by two additional genes bioi and orf2 bioi and orf2 show no similarity to any other known biotin biosynthetic genes the bioi gene encodes a protein with similarity to cytochrome p-450s and was able to complement mutations in either bioc or bioh of e coli mutations in bioi caused b subtilis to grow poorly in the absence of biotin the bradytroph phenotype of bioi mutants was overcome by pimelic acid suggesting that the product of bioi functions at a step prior to pimelic acid synthesis the b subtilis bio operon is preceded by a putative vegetative promoter sequence and contains just downstream a region of dyad symmetry with homology to the bio regulatory region of b sphaericus analysis of a biow-lacz translational fusion indicated that expression of the biotin operon is regulated by biotin and the b subtilis bira gene
B,the methylesterase which catalyzes demethylation of chemotactic membrane receptors in salmonella typhimurium has been purified and characterized two forms of the enzyme have been isolated from cell extracts one corresponds in molecular weight mr  37000 and amino acid composition to the predicted product of the structural gene for the methylesterase cheb the other is a proteolytic fragment mr  21000 corresponding to the c-terminal three-fifths of the intact cheb protein the specific activity of the 21-kda enzyme is at least 15-fold greater than that of its 37-kda precursor we conclude that the cheb protein is composed of at least two structurally distinct portions a c-terminal catalytic domain and an n-terminal region which modulates esterase activity
E,the gamma subunit of the nak-atpase is a small membrane protein that copurifies with the alpha and beta subunits of the enzyme strong evidence that the gamma subunit is a component of the nak-atpase comes from studies indicating that the subunit is involved in forming the site for cardiac glycoside binding we have isolated and characterized the cdnas coding the gamma subunit from several species the gamma subunit is a highly conserved protein consisting of 58 amino acids with a molecular weight of 6500 hydropathy analysis reveals the presence of a single hydrophobic domain that is sufficient to cross the membrane there are no sites for n-linked glycosylation northern blot analysis revealed that the gamma subunit mrna is expressed in a tissue-specific fashion and is present in all tissues characterized gamma-specific antibodies have been used to verify that the sequenced protein is the same protein labeled by 3hnitroazidobenzoyl-ouabain nab-ouabain and that this protein the gamma subunit of the nak-atpase has a distribution pattern along nephron segments that is identical with the alpha subunit in addition coimmunoprecipitation of the alpha beta and gamma subunits demonstrate specific association of the subunits these results are consistent with the notion that the gamma subunit is specifically associated with and may be an important component of the nak-atpase
B,a tuf-gene of flexistipes sinusarabici has been cloned and sequenced the primary structure of the predicted elongation factor protein was compared with available sequences of homologous genes and elongation factors tu or 1 alpha of eubacteria archaebacteria and eukaryotes based on elongation factor tu data flexistipes sinusarabici belongs to the eubacterial kingdom but no specific relationship to any phylum was detected the amino acid of the elongation factor tu of f sinusarabici exhibits no striking pecularities among the highly conserved positions only two are different sites of known or postulated functions are conserved
E,pcr was used to amplify fragments corresponding to chs genes from ustilago maydis utilizing as primers oligonucleotides devised according to the conserved regions of fungal chs genes the pcr product was employed as a probe to screen a genomic library of the fungus two different chs genes umchs1 and umchs2 were thus identified in the positive clones recovered their sequence revealed high similarity with the chs genes previously cloned from other fungi especially in their central region alignment with the deduced protein sequences of all chs genes reported up to date showed the existence of seven conserved domains transcripts from both genes were detected in the yeast and mycelial forms in general the transcripts from the umchs1 gene appeared to be present at a higher level than the transcripts from the umchs2 gene the transcripts from both genes appeared to be more abundant in the mycelial form gene replacement of either gene and analysis of the resulting phenotype demonstrated that they are non-essential nevertheless growth chitin synthase activity levels and chitin content of mycelial cells induced by cultivation in acidic media were all reduced in chs1 and chs2 mutants however mating virulence and dimorphic behaviour were unaffected overall the results indicate that the chs1 and chs2 genes encode products with redundant functions in u maydis
E,a murine monoclonal antibody was identified by its ability to induce a reversible antiproliferative effect on a human lymphoma cell line immunoprecipitation studies revealed that the antibody reacted with a 26-kilodalton cell surface protein tapa-1 a diverse group of human cell lines including hematolymphoid neuroectodermal and mesenchymal cells expressed the tapa-1 protein many of the lymphoid cell lines in particular those derived from large cell lymphomas were susceptible to the antiproliferative effects of the antibody tapa-1 may therefore play an important role in the regulation of lymphoma cell growth a cdna clone coding for tapa-1 was isolated by using the monoclonal antibody to screen an expression library in cos cells analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence indicated that the protein is highly hydrophobic and that it contains four putative transmembrane domains and a potential n-myristoylation site tapa-1 showed strong homology with the cd37 leukocyte antigen and with the me491 melanoma-associated antigen both of which have been implicated in the regulation of cell growth
E,we report here the cloning of a cdna encoding testosterone 7 alpha-hydroxylase in the syrian hamster designated cyp2a9 overlapping clones encoding syrian hamster cyp2a9 were isolated by screening a liver cdna library and by performing rapid amplification of cdna ends polymerase chain reaction on the cdna library the sequence of the cyp2a9 cdna contains an open reading frame of 1482 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of 493 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 56295 da the sequence is flanked by a 5'-untranslated region of 10 bp and a 3'-untranslated region of 178 bp including the polya tail the deduced amino acid sequence shares significant homology with members of cyp2a subfamily notably with cyp2a1 and cyp2a12 which have testosterone 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity we characterized the catalytic activity of cyp2a9 using microsomes obtained by transient expression of its cdna in transfected cos-7 cells cyp2a9 was found to hydroxylate testosterone at position 7 alpha in syrian hamster livers a higher level of testosterone 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity as well as the mrna of cyp2a9 in male than in female was obtained the testosterone 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity and the mrna level in liver were both decreased moderately by administration of 3-methylcholanthrene and slightly by administration of phenobarbital in contrast in kidney both 3-methylcholanthrene and phenobarbital significantly decreased the mrna level these facts indicate that the regulation of the hamster testosterone 7 alpha-hydroxylase cyp2a9 expression is different from that of the rat cyp2a1 and hamster reported previously by other workers
E,the clock gene is an essential regulator of circadian rhythms it encodes a member of the basic helix-loop-helixper-arnt-sim family of transcription factors known to play a central role in the control of diverse cellular events previously we described the functional identification and molecular isolation of the clock gene in the mouse its interaction with the bmal1 protein and the role of this complex as a transcriptional activator in the circadian pacemaker here we report the cloning exon organization chromosomal location and mrna expression of the human clock gene the coding sequence of human clock extends for 2538 bp and is 89 identical to its mouse ortholog its deduced amino acid sequence is 846 residues long and is 96 identical to mouse clock radiation hybrid mapping localized human clock to the long arm of human chromosome 4 4q12 direct sequencing of a genomic clock clone indicated that the coding sequence of human clock extends over 20 exons and that its intronexon organization is identical to that of the mouse ortholog northern blot analysis indicated widespread expression of two major transcripts of 8 and 10 kb and in situ hybridization of human brain tissue revealed elevated expression of clock mrna in the suprachiasmatic nuclei the locus of circadian control in mammals and in the cerebellum comparison of cdna clones revealed two single nucleotide polymorphisms in noncoding sequence flanking the clock open reading frame the central role of clock in the organization of circadian rhythms suggests that it will be a useful candidate gene for genetic analyses of disorders associated with dysfunction of the circadian system
A,the archaeon methanosarcina mazei and related species are of great ecological importance as they are the only organisms fermenting acetate methylamines and methanol to methane carbon dioxide and ammonia in case of methylamines since acetate is the precursor of 60 of the methane produced on earth these organisms contribute significantly to the production of this greenhouse gas eg in rice paddies the 4096345 base pairs circular chromosome of m mazei is more than twice as large as the genomes of the methanogenic archaea currently completely sequenced bult et al 1996 smith et al 1997 3371 open reading frames orfs were identified based on currently available sequence data 376 of these orfs are methanosarcina-specific and 1043 orfs find their closest homologue in the bacterial domain 544 of these orfs reach significant similarity values only in the bacterial domain they include 56 of the 102 transposases and proteins involved in gluconeogenesis proline biosynthesis transport processes dna-repair environmental sensing gene regulation and stress response striking examples are the occurrence of the bacterial groelgroes chaperone system and the presence of tetrahydrofolate-dependent enzymes these findings might indicate that lateral gene transfer has played an important evolutionary role in forging the physiology of this metabolically versatile methanogen
E,we have isolated a cdna clone which encodes the entire beta-subunit of human electron-transferring flavoprotein etf by screening an expression library from human liver using polyclonal antibodies against porcine etf this cdna encodes a protein of 255 amino-acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 27877 da which shows a high degree of similarity with partial amino-acid sequences obtained from both rat liver and paracoccus denitrificans beta-etf northern-blot analysis shows that the human beta-etf mrna is approximately 1 kb in size and is abundant in liver heart and skeletal muscle incubation with intact mitochondria indicates that the cdna-encoded beta-etf polypeptide contains the information necessary to reach the mitochondrial matrix these data are in agreement with previous experiments suggesting that beta-etf unlike the majority of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial matrix proteins does not have a cleavable leader peptide furthermore when valinomycin is added to the incubation mixture the import is abolished thus demonstrating that it is an energy-dependent process interestingly the sequence analysis of beta-etf protein identifies a 263 identity with the fix a gene product of the nitrogen-fixing bacterium azorhizobium caulinodans
B,the gram-negative bacterium yersinia pestis is the causative agent of the systemic invasive infectious disease classically referred to as plague and has been responsible for three human pandemics the justinian plague sixth to eighth centuries the black death fourteenth to nineteenth centuries and modern plague nineteenth century to the present day the recent identification of strains resistant to multiple drugs and the potential use of y pestis as an agent of biological warfare mean that plague still poses a threat to human health here we report the complete genome sequence of y pestis strain co92 consisting of a 465-megabase mb chromosome and three plasmids of 962 kilobases kb 703 kb and 96 kb the genome is unusually rich in insertion sequences and displays anomalies in gc base-composition bias indicating frequent intragenomic recombination many genes seem to have been acquired from other bacteria and viruses including adhesins secretion systems and insecticidal toxins the genome contains around 150 pseudogenes many of which are remnants of a redundant enteropathogenic lifestyle the evidence of ongoing genome fluidity expansion and decay suggests y pestis is a pathogen that has undergone large-scale genetic flux and provides a unique insight into the ways in which new and highly virulent pathogens evolve
E,we have sequenced a 61989 bp stretch located between genes rad7 and fip1 of saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome x this stretch contains 36 open reading frames orfs of at least 100 codons fourteen of these correspond to sequences previously published as hit1 cdc8 yap17 cbf1 nat1 rpa12 cct5 tor1 rfc2 pem2 cdc11 mir1 ste18 and grr1 the proteins deduced from four orfs yjr059w yjr065c yjr075w yjr078w have significant similarity to proteins of known function from yeast or other organisms including s cerevisiae serinethreonine-specific protein kinase schizosaccharomyces pombe act2 protein s cerevisiae mannosyltransferase och1 protein and mouse indoleamine 23-dioxygenase respectively four of the remaining 18 orfs have similarity to proteins with unknown function six are weakly similar to other known sequences while another eight exhibit no similarity to any known sequence in addition three trna genes have been recognized three genes clustered within 22 kb yjr059w yjr061w and tor1 have counterparts arranged within 15 kb on the left arm of chromosome xi
E,the camp-dependent protein kinase pka is localized to specific subcellular compartments by association with a-kinase anchoring proteins akaps akaps are a family of functionally related proteins that bind the regulatory r subunit of pka with high affinity and target the kinase to specific subcellular organelles recently akap18 a low molecular weight plasma membrane akap that facilitates pka-mediated phosphorylation of the l-type ca2 channel was cloned we now report the cloning of two additional isoforms of akap18 which we have designated akap18beta and akap18gamma that arise from alternative mrna splicing the akap18 isoforms share a common r subunit binding site but have distinct targeting domains the original akap18 renamed akap18alpha and akap18beta target the plasma membrane when expressed in hek-293 cells while akap18gamma is cytosolic when expressed in epithelial cells akap18alpha is targeted to lateral membranes whereas akap18beta is accumulated at the apical membrane a 23-amino acid insert following the plasma membrane targeting domain facilitates the association of akap18beta with the apical membrane the data suggest that akap18 isoforms are differentially targeted to modulate distinct intracellular signaling events furthermore the data suggest that plasma membrane akaps may be targeted to subdomains of the cell surface adding additional specificity in intracellular signaling
E,a cdna which encodes a carboxylesterase of 561 amino acid residues including a cleavable signal peptide is described the enzyme expressed in cos cells migrates during page sds- and non-denaturing as a single prominent band in the region of liver es-4 it ends in the c-terminal cell-retention signal -hnel which in cos cells overexpressing the enzyme appears to be slightly less efficient than the signals -htel and -hvel of es-3 and es-10 respectively glycosylation is not essential for intracellular retention but leads to a higher activity as do many carboxylesterases the enzyme expressed in cos cells hydrolyses omicron-nitrophenyl acetate and alpha-naphthyl acetate it also hydrolyses acetanilide although less efficiently than es-3 and distinctively palmitoyl-coa in addition to the four canonical cys residues of the carboxylesterases it contains a fifth unpaired cys336 which apparently is not essential for the catalytic properties indeed treatment with iodoacetamide or substitution of cys336 by phe does not markedly alter the activity of the enzyme on the various substrates the predicted structure of es-4 is highly homologous to that of two other recently cloned esterases which also end in -hnel yan yang brady and parkinson 1994 j biol chem 269 29688-29696 yan yang and parkinson 1995 arch biochem biophys 317 222-234 together these isoenzymes probably account for the closely spaced bands observed in the region of es-4 in non-denaturing page
E,the developmentally-regulated neuron-specific protein drebrin a is expressed first at the time of outgrowth and maturation of dendrites and is localized within dendrites of the adult brain a cdna clone of adult rat drebrin a was isolated and sequenced there is no overall homology with other reported protein sequences except chicken drebrins we constructed the expression vector miw-da containing the drebrin a cdna transfection of nonneuronal cells with miw-da induced the formation of highly branched neurite-like cell processes in these process-bearing transfectants expressed debrin a is concentrated in submembraneous regions of the cell furthermore actin concentration is higher in these cells than other fibroblasts these results suggest a possible role of drebrin a in neurite outgrowth
V,the complete dna sequence of the genome of vaccinia virus has been determined the genome consisted of 191636 bp with a base composition of 666 a  t we have identified 198 major protein-coding regions and 65 overlapping minor regions for a total of 263 potential genes genes encoded by the virus were located by examination of dna sequence characteristics and compared with existing vaccinia virus mapping analyses sequence data and transcription data these genes were found to be compactly organized along the genome with relatively few regions of noncoding sequences whereas several similarities to proteins of known function were discerned the function of the majority of proteins encoded by these open reading frames is as yet undetermined
E,as part of our effort to sequence the 100-megabase mb genome of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans we have completed the nucleotide sequence of a contiguous 2181032 base pairs in the central gene cluster of chromosome iii analysis of the finished sequence has indicated an average density of about one gene per five kilobases comparison with the public sequence databases reveals similarities to previously known genes for about one gene in three in addition the genomic sequence contains several intriguing features including putative gene duplications and a variety of other repeats with potential evolutionary implications
E,urea-extractable proteins have been purified from the cephalothoracic cuticle of mature araneus diadematus spiders two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed at least 12 major proteins with pis between 45 and 85 five proteins were purified and their primary structure determined using a combination of mass spectrometry and edman degradation based on the amino acid sequence the proteins can be divided into two groups both characterized by hydrophobic regions dominated by ala pro and val sequence similarity was observed between all the spider cuticle proteins and a number of proteins from other arthropod cuticles although the similarity seemed to be confined only to a region in the central part of the molecules it does link these very distantly related species
E,a recently recognized gene family conserved from yeast to humans includes down syndrome candidate region 1 gene dscr1 adapt78 recognized as the hamster ortholog of the dscr1 isoform 4 zaki-4 renamed dscr1-like 1 dscr1l1 and dscr1l2 a novel gene on human chromosome 1 along with yeast and c elegans single members strippoli p lenzi l petrini m carinci p zannotti m 2000 a new gene family including dscr1 down syndrome candidate region 1 and zaki-4 characterization from yeast to human and identification of dscr1-like 2 a novel human member genomics 64 252-263 the proposed family labels were a putative single-strand nucleic acid binding domain similar to the rna recognition motif and a unique highly-conserved serine-proline motif we have used a bioinformatics-driven molecular biology approach to characterize the murine members of dscr1-like gene family systematic expressed-sequence-tags est database search and reverse-transcription polymerase chain rection rt-pcr product sequencing allowed identification of the murine dscr1 dscr1l1 and dscr1l2 the sequences of the respective protein products are of 198 197 and 241 amino acids respectively and are very similar to the corresponding human proteins the very broad expression pattern of the murine dscr1 genes is similar to that of the human genes using a radiation hybrid panel we mapped the murine dscr1-like family members the murine dscr1 ortholog is located on the chromosome 16 in a region corresponding to that on human chromosome 21 just upstream of the down syndrome candidate region dscr1l1 and dscr1l2 murine genes are also located in chromosomal segments of chromosome 17 and 4 respectively exactly corresponding to those containing the respective human homologs on chromosomes 6 and 1 description of the mouse orthologs for dscr1-like genes will allow knockout mice to be obtained for specific family members
E,the cca-adding enzyme atptrna adenylyltransferase or ctptrna cytidylyltransferase ec  generates the conserved cca sequence responsible for the attachment of amino acid at the 3' terminus of trna molecules it was shown that enzymes from various organisms strictly recognize the elbow region of trna formed by the conserved d- and t-loops however most of the mammalian mitochondrial mt trnas lack consensus sequences in both d- and t-loops to characterize the mammalian mt cca-adding enzymes we have partially purified the enzyme from bovine liver mitochondria and determined cdna sequences from human and mouse dbests by mass spectrometric analysis the identified sequences contained typical amino-terminal peptides for mitochondrial protein import and had characteristics of the class ii nucleotidyltransferase superfamily that includes eukaryotic and eubacterial cca-adding enzymes the human recombinant enzyme was overexpressed in escherichia coli and its cca-adding activity was characterized using several mt trnas as substrates the results clearly show that the human mt cca-adding enzyme can efficiently repair mt trnas that are poor substrates for the e coli enzyme although both enzymes work equally well on cytoplasmic trnas this suggests that the mammalian mt enzymes have evolved so as to recognize mt trnas with unusual structures
E,to study the molecular regulation of voltage-dependent ca2 channels vdccs in the beta-cell we have cloned a cdna for the alpha 1-subunit from a hamster insulin-secreting cell line hit-t15 the cdna hca3a encodes a 1610-amino acid protein with four repeating membrane domains and an overall structure characteristic of other alpha 1-subunits although the cdna shows a high degree of sequence homology 97 with a rat brain alpha 1-subunit rb alpha 1 the c-terminal 15 amino acids of hca3a share no similarity with any cloned alpha 1 protein high stringency northern blot analysis revealed a single transcript of approximately 86 kilobases in hit cells and hamster pancreas a similarly sized species was detected in hamster brain heart and skeletal muscle using polymerase chain reaction and a primer set unique to hca3a this alpha 1 isoform was found to be expressed in islet cell lines derived from rat mouse and hamster the hit cell alpha 1-subunit is also expressed in discrete regions of the rat central nervous system including the cortex cerebellum hypothalamus and brain stem the expression of two alpha 1 isoforms hca3a and cardiac in the hit cell underscores the possible complexity of vdccs in the regulation of beta-cell signal transduction with its widespread tissue distribution hca3a does not conform to the current classification system used for l-type vdccs this suggests that an alternative system of classification is required
B,staphylococcus epidermidis strains are diverse in their pathogenicity some are invasive and cause serious nosocomial infections whereas others are non-pathogenic commensal organisms to analyse the implications of different virulence factors in staphylococcus epidermidis infections the complete genome of staphylococcus epidermidis strain atcc 12228 a non-biofilm forming non-infection associated strain used for detection of residual antibiotics in food products was sequenced this strain showed low virulence by mouse and rat experimental infections the genome consists of a single 2499 279 bp chromosome and six plasmids the chromosomal g  c content is 321 and 2419 protein coding sequences cds are predicted among which 230 are putative novel genes compared to the virulence factors in staphylococcus aureus aside from delta-haemolysin and beta-haemolysin other toxin genes were not found in contrast the majority of adhesin genes are intact in atcc 12228 most strikingly the ica operon coding for the enzymes synthesizing interbacterial cellular polysaccharide is missing in atcc 12228 and rearrangements of adjacent genes are shown no mec genes is256 is257 were found in atcc 12228 it is suggested that the absence of the ica operon is a genetic marker in commensal staphylococcus epidermidis strains which are less likely to become invasive
B,helicobacter pylori one of the most common bacterial pathogens of humans colonizes the gastric mucosa where it appears to persist throughout the host's life unless the patient is treated colonization induces chronic gastric inflammation which can progress to a variety of diseases ranging in severity from superficial gastritis and peptic ulcer to gastric cancer and mucosal-associated lymphoma strain-specific genetic diversity has been proposed to be involved in the organism's ability to cause different diseases or even be beneficial to the infected host and to participate in the lifelong chronicity of infection here we compare the complete genomic sequences of two unrelated h pylori isolates this is to our knowledge the first such genomic comparison h pylori was believed to exhibit a large degree of genomic and allelic diversity but we find that the overall genomic organization gene order and predicted proteomes sets of proteins encoded by the genomes of the two strains are quite similar between 6 to 7 of the genes are specific to each strain with almost half of these genes being clustered in a single hypervariable region
B,the role of the periplasmic disulfide oxidoreductase dsba in yop secretion was investigated in yersinia pestis a y pestis dsba mutant secreted reduced amounts of the v antigen and yops and expressed reduced amounts of the full-sized yscc protein site-directed mutagenesis of the four cysteine residues present in the yscc protein resulted in defects similar to those found in the dsba mutant these results suggest that yscc contains at least one disulfide bond that is essential for the function of this protein in yop secretion
B,neisseria meningitidis causes bacterial meningitis and is therefore responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality in both the developed and the developing world meningococci are opportunistic pathogens that colonize the nasopharynges and oropharynges of asymptomatic carriers for reasons that are still mostly unknown they occasionally gain access to the blood and subsequently to the cerebrospinal fluid to cause septicaemia and meningitis n meningitidis strains are divided into a number of serogroups on the basis of the immunochemistry of their capsular polysaccharides serogroup a strains are responsible for major epidemics and pandemics of meningococcal disease and therefore most of the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease here we have determined the complete genome sequence of a serogroup a strain of neisseria meningitidis z2491 the sequence is 2184406 base pairs in length with an overall gc content of 518 and contains 2121 predicted coding sequences the most notable feature of the genome is the presence of many hundreds of repetitive elements ranging from short repeats positioned either singly or in large multiple arrays to insertion sequences and gene duplications of one kilobase or more many of these repeats appear to be involved in genome fluidity and antigenic variation in this important human pathogen
E,ornithine decarboxylase of the african trypanosome trypanosoma brucei brucei had an estimated native molecular weight of 100000 by gel filtration and a subunit molecular weight of 45000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the gene encoding this enzyme present in a single copy in t brucei was identified by mouse ornithine decarboxylase cdna under relatively stringent conditions of hybridization and subcloned in a 59-kilobase kb ssti fragment from a cosmid clone into the plasmid puc 19 this clone encompassed a 28-kb sstii fragment that contained the entire t brucei ornithine decarboxylase gene the 28-kb sstii fragment hybridized to a 24-kb mrna that presumably encodes the parasite enzyme the 28-kb sstii fragment was partially sequenced and found to contain an open reading frame of 445 amino acids that has 615 homology with the corresponding sequence of the mouse enzyme the only major discrepancies between the two enzymes are the addition of a 20-amino acid n-terminal peptide and the deletion of a 36-amino acid c-terminal peptide and the t brucei ornithine decarboxylase the c terminus has been postulated to be one of the structural factors associated with rapid in vivo turnover of mammalian ornithine decarboxylase the absence of this c-terminal peptide in t brucei ornithine decarboxylase predicts a slow turnover for the parasite enzyme in vivo and this is supported by our experimental data the lack of turnover of ornithine decarboxylase in trypanosomes may constitute the basis of selective antitrypanosomal action of the irreversible enzyme inhibitor dl-alpha-difluoromethylornithine
E,three unlinked genes argri argrii and argiii are necessary to control the synthesis of the arginine anabolic and catabolic genes the three genes have been cloned and sequenced and we report here the results for the argri and argriii genes they encode proteins of 177 and 355 amino acids respectively the argriii protein has a very acidic carboxy-terminus 17 aspartate residues from a comparison of the sequences the argri and argriii gene products do not show the common characteristics of other dna binding proteins nuclear localization and putative dna binding site in contrast to the argrii regulatory protein the transcription of both genes is not affected by the presence of arginine in the growth medium
B,the comparison of the genomes of two very closely related human mucosal pathogens mycoplasma genitalium and mycoplasma pneumoniae has helped define the essential functions of a self-replicating minimal cell as well as what constitutes a mycoplasma here we report the complete sequence of a more distant phylogenetic relative of those bacteria ureaplasma urealyticum parvum biovar which is also a mucosal pathogen of humans it is the third mycoplasma to be sequenced and has the smallest sequenced prokaryotic genome except for m genitalium although the u urealyticum genome is similar to the two sequenced mycoplasma genomes features make this organism unique among mycoplasmas and all bacteria almost all atp synthesis is the result of urea hydrolysis which generates an energy-producing electrochemical gradient some highly conserved eubacterial enzymes appear not to be encoded by u urealyticum including the cell-division protein ftsz chaperonins groes and groel and ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase u urealyticum has six closely related iron transporters which apparently arose through gene duplication suggesting that it has a kind of respiration system not present in other small genome bacteria the genome is only 255 gc in nucleotide content and the gc content of individual genes may predict how essential those genes are to ureaplasma survival
E,protein arginine methylation is a prevalent posttranslational modification in eukaryotic cells that has been implicated in signal transduction the metabolism of nascent pre-rna and the transcriptional activation processes in searching the human genome for protein arginine n-methyltransferase prmt family members a novel gene has been found on chromosome 1 that encodes for an apparent methyltransferase prmt6 the polypeptide chain of prmt6 is 419 kda consisting of a catalytic core sequence common to other prmt enzymes expressed as a glutathione s-transferase fusion protein prmt6 demonstrates type i prmt activity capable of forming both omega-ng-monomethylarginine and asymmetric omega-ngng-dimethylarginine derivatives on the recombinant glycine- and arginine-rich substrate in a processive manner with a specific activity of 144 pmol methyl groups transferred min-1 mg-1 enzyme a comparison of substrate specificity reveals that prmt6 is functionally distinct from two previously characterized type i enzymes prmt1 and prmt4 in addition prmt6 displays automethylation activity it is the first prmt to do so this novel human prmt which resides solely in the nucleus when fused to the green fluorescent protein joins a family of enzymes with diverse functions within cells
E,n-formyl peptides fmlp and complement fragment c5a are neutrophil chemoattractants in humans a single-copy gene was identified for the c5a receptor and the receptor for fmlp fpr1 is encoded by a single gene that shows 53 amino acid similarity to the c5ar two other human fpr1 homologues fpr-like 1 fpr2fprl1 and fpr-like 2 fprl2 have been cloned the human c5ar fpr1 fprl1 and fprl2 are physically linked by direct sequencing or by sequencing plasmid clones we studied the c5ar and fpr genes from four non-human primates chimpanzee gorilla orangutan and macaque the sequences showed 95 - 99 similarity to the human homologues with the major divergences observed in macaque in these genes the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domains are highly conserved while the highest divergence corresponded to the extracellular loops involved in ligand binding additionally we constructed a physical map of these genes in non-human primates in all species the four genes were physically linked and we defined the relative orientation of the four genes in primates c5arfpr1fpr2 fprl1fprl2
V,the v-cath gene of the autographa californica multi-nucleocapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus acmnpv encodes a cathepsin l-like proteinase which plays a role in the liquefaction of host tissues during a viral infection 1 we have identified a homologous gene in the spruce budworm virus choristoneura fumiferana mnpv cfmnpv the cfmnpv v-cath gene is 74 identical to acmnpv v-cath at the nucleotide sequence level and 80 identical at the level of predicted amino acid sequence transcription analysis of the cfmnpv v-cath gene revealed that it is expressed late in infection and that transcription initiates within the consensus baculovirus late-promoter motif
E,complementary dna clones encoding the human kidney epidermal growth factor egf precursor have been isolated and sequenced they predict the sequence of a 1207 amino acid protein which contains egf flanked by polypeptide segments of 970 and 184 residues at its nh2- and cooh-termini respectively the structural organization of the human egf precursor is similar to that previously described for the mouse protein and there is 66 identity between the two sequences transfection of cos-7 cells with the human egf precursor cdna linked to the sv40 early promoter indicate that it can be synthesized as a membrane protein with its nh2-terminus external to the cell surface the human egf precursor gene is approximately 110 kilobase pairs and has 24 exons its exon-intron organization revealed that various domains of the egf precursor are encoded by individual exons moreover 15 of the 24 exons encode protein segments that are homologous to sequences in other proteins exon duplication and shuffling appear to have played an important role in determining the present structure of this protein
E,we report the primary structure of three novel putative zinc metalloproteases designated adam-ts5 adam-ts6 and adam-ts7 all have a similar domain organization comprising a preproregion a reprolysin-type catalytic domain a disintegrin-like domain a thrombospondin type-1 ts module a cysteine-rich domain a spacer domain without cysteine residues and a cooh-terminal ts module these genes are differentially regulated during mouse embryogenesis and in adult tissues with adamts5 highly expressed in the peri-implantation period in embryo and trophoblast these proteins are similar to four other cognate gene products defining a distinct family of human reprolysin-like metalloproteases the adam-ts family the other members of the family are adam-ts1 an inflammation-induced gene the procollagen iii amino-propeptide processing enzyme pcinp adam-ts2 and proteins predicted by the kiaa0366 and kiaa0688 genes adam-ts3 and adam-ts4 individual adam-ts members differ in the number of cooh-terminal ts modules and some have unique cooh-terminal domains the adam-ts genes are dispersed in human and mouse genomes
B,here we determine the complete genomic sequence of the gram negative gamma-proteobacterium vibrio cholerae el tor n16961 to be 4033460 base pairs bp the genome consists of two circular chromosomes of 2961146 bp and 1072314 bp that together encode 3885 open reading frames the vast majority of recognizable genes for essential cell functions such as dna replication transcription translation and cell-wall biosynthesis and pathogenicity for example toxins surface antigens and adhesins are located on the large chromosome in contrast the small chromosome contains a larger fraction 59 of hypothetical genes compared with the large chromosome 42 and also contains many more genes that appear to have origins other than the gamma-proteobacteria the small chromosome also carries a gene capture system the integron island and host 'addiction' genes that are typically found on plasmids thus the small chromosome may have originally been a megaplasmid that was captured by an ancestral vibrio species the v cholerae genomic sequence provides a starting point for understanding how a free-living environmental organism emerged to become a significant human bacterial pathogen
B,lactococcus lactis is a nonpathogenic at-rich gram-positive bacterium closely related to the genus streptococcus and is the most commonly used cheese starter it is also the best-characterized lactic acid bacterium we sequenced the genome of the laboratory strain il1403 using a novel two-step strategy that comprises diagnostic sequencing of the entire genome and a shotgun polishing step the genome contains 2365589 base pairs and encodes 2310 proteins including 293 protein-coding genes belonging to six prophages and 43 insertion sequence is elements nonrandom distribution of is elements indicates that the chromosome of the sequenced strain may be a product of recent recombination between two closely related genomes a complete set of late competence genes is present indicating the ability of l lactis to undergo dna transformation genomic sequence revealed new possibilities for fermentation pathways and for aerobic respiration it also indicated a horizontal transfer of genetic information from lactococcus to gram-negative enteric bacteria of salmonella-escherichia group
B,we have sequenced the genome of the intracellular symbiont buchnera aphidicola from the aphid baizongia pistacea this strain diverged 80-150 million years ago from the common ancestor of two previously sequenced buchnera strains here a field-collected nonclonal sample of insects was used as source material for laboratory procedures as a consequence the genome assembly unveiled intrapopulational variation consisting of approximately 1200 polymorphic sites comparison of the 618-kb kbp genome with the two other buchnera genomes revealed a nearly perfect gene-order conservation indicating that the onset of genomic stasis coincided closely with establishment of the symbiosis with aphids approximately 200 million years ago extensive genome reduction also predates the synchronous diversification of buchnera and its host but at a slower rate gene loss continues among the extant lineages a computational study of protein folding predicts that proteins in buchnera as well as proteins of other intracellular bacteria are generally characterized by smaller folding efficiency compared with proteins of free living bacteria these and other degenerative genomic features are discussed in light of compensatory processes and theoretical predictions on the long-term evolutionary fate of symbionts like buchnera
B,two tn5 lac insertions into the myxococcus genome at sites omega 4414 and omega 4473 which are separated by 550 nucleotides inactivate fruiting body development sporulation is decreased 100- to 10000-fold at least two genes devr and devs are transcribed in this region probably as an operon expression of devr begins by 6 h after starvation has initiated development on the basis of their nucleotide sequences devr and devs are expected to encode proteins of 302 and 214 amino acids respectively dev function can be restored by a segment of 78 kb cloned from the devrs region of wild-type cells two experiments show that devr expression is under strong negative autoregulation beta-galactosidase is expressed at a higher level from a transcriptional devrlacz fusion when the fused operon is in a dev strain than when it is in the devdev genetic background of a partial diploid there is more mrna accumulation from the devrs region in the dev strain than in a rescued devdev tandem duplication strain sporulation rescue is correlated with some degree of negative autoregulation even though sporulation is not inversely proportional to beta-galactosidase expression from omega 4414 a second level of regulation is suggested by complementation of dev by dev in duplication strains the expression of devrs measured by sporulation levels differs 1000-fold when devrs is moved from a distance of 20 kb to 3 mb from the mutant devrs locus expression of devr is also dependent on the cell density at which development is initiated a third level of regulation multiple levels of regulation suggest that devrs is a switch required to activate completion of aggregation and sporulation
E,the national institutes of health mammalian gene collection mgc program is a multiinstitutional effort to identify and sequence a cdna clone containing a complete orf for each human and mouse gene ests were generated from libraries enriched for full-length cdnas and analyzed to identify candidate full-orf clones which then were sequenced to high accuracy the mgc has currently sequenced and verified the full orf for a nonredundant set of 9000 human and 6000 mouse genes candidate full-orf clones for an additional 7800 human and 3500 mouse genes also have been identified all mgc sequences and clones are available without restriction through public databases and clone distribution networks see httpmgcncinihgov
E,the complete nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial genome of a platypus ornithorhynchus anatinus was determined its overall genomic organization is similar to that of placental mammals xenopus laevis and fishes however it contains an apparently noncoding sequence of 88 base pairs located between the genes for trnaleuuur and nd1 the base composition of this sequence and its conservation among monotremes as well as the existence of a transcript from one of the strands indicate that it may have a hitherto-unknown function when the protein-coding sequences are used to reconstruct a phylogeny of mammals the data suggest that monotremes and marsupials are sister groups and thus that placental mammals represent the most ancient divergence among mammals
B,the primary structures of the immunity imm and lysis lys proteins and the c-terminal 205 amino acid residues of colicin e8 were deduced from nucleotide sequencing of the 1265 bp clai-pvui dna fragment of plasmid cole8-j the gene order is col-imm-lys confirming previous genetic data a comparison of the colicin e8 peptide sequence with the available colicin e2-p9 sequence shows an identical receptor-binding domain but 20 amino acid replacements and a clustering of synonymous codon usage in the nuclease-active region sequence homology of the two colicins indicates that they are descended from a common ancestral gene and that colicin e8 like colicin e2 may also function as a dna endonuclease the native cole8 imm resident copy is 258 bp long and is predicted to encode an acidic protein of 9604 mol wt the six amino acid replacements between the resident imm and the previously reported non-resident copy of the cole8 imm e8 imm found in the ribonuclease-producing cole3-ca38 plasmid offer an explanation for the incomplete protection conferred by e8 imm to exogenously added colicin e8 except for one nucleotide and amino acid change in the putative signal peptide sequence the cole8 lys structure is identical to that present in cole2-p9 and cole3-ca38
B,sequence analysis of the drrab locus from streptomyces peucetius american type culture collection 29050 reveals the presence of two genes drra and drrb both of which are required for daunorubicin and doxorubicin adriamycin resistance in the heterologous host streptomyces lividans the drra protein is similar to a large family of atp-binding transport proteins including the proteins encoded by the mdr genes from mammalian tumor cells which confer resistance to daunorubicin doxorubicin and some other structurally unrelated chemotherapeutic agents the drrb protein shows no significant similarity to other known proteins but is probably very hydrophobic suggesting that it is located in the bacterial membrane these two proteins may act jointly to confer daunorubicin and doxorubicin resistance by an analog of the antiport mechanism established for mammalian tumor cells that contain amplified or overexpressed mdr genes transcriptional analysis of the drrab region supports the presence of one transcript containing drra and drrb and indicates that these genes are expressed only during antibiotic production
B,the 4 202 353 bp genome of the alkaliphilic bacterium bacillus halodurans c-125 contains 4066 predicted protein coding sequences cdss 2141 527 of which have functional assignments 1182 29 of which are conserved cdss with unknown function and 743 18 3 of which have no match to any protein database among the total cdss 88 match sequences of proteins found only in bacillus subtilis and 667 are widely conserved in comparison with the proteins of various organisms including bsubtilis the b halodurans genome contains 112 transposase genes indicating that transposases have played an important evolutionary role in horizontal gene transfer and also in internal genetic rearrangement in the genome strain c-125 lacks some of the necessary genes for competence such as coms srfa and rapc supporting the fact that competence has not been demonstrated experimentally in c-125 there is no paralog of tupa encoding teichuronopeptide which contributes to alkaliphily in the c-125 genome and an ortholog of tupa cannot be found in the bsubtilis genome out of 11 sigma factors which belong to the extracytoplasmic function family 10 are unique to b halodurans suggesting that they may have a role in the special mechanism of adaptation to an alkaline environment
E,the complete nucleotide sequence of murine complement receptor type 2 cr2 was determined from two overlapping cdna clones derived from a lambda gt11 library of late pre-b cell origin comparison of the predicted sequence of the 1014 amino acid murine homolog with that of human cr2 revealed marked evolutionary conservation the murine molecule was 65 identical to human cr2 overall lacking a single repetitive sequence variably present in man the 15 approximately 60-75 amino acid short consensus repeats scr that constitute the entire extracellular domain of murine cr2 were 53 to 81 identical to and could be directly aligned with the human protein as reported the cytoplasmic tail shared 79 amino acid identity with human cr2 whereas that of the transmembrane was only 33 murine cr2 contained 16 potential n-linked glycosylation sites of which 6 were conserved 4 altered and 6 lost during human evolution the hydropathicity profile of the two molecules was nearly colinear with some variation in the n-terminal region of the first repeat as well as within the sixth and twelfth repeats rna blot analysis revealed a approximately 40 to 50 kb message in murine b lymphocytes which was absent in t lymphocytes thymus and spleen liver brain lung kidney and heart a method was devised to more precisely compare the repeat structures an identity matrix analysis suggests that human ancestral cr2 evolved before divergence of the rodent and primate branches of the evolutionary tree through a series of predictable gene duplications possibly giving rise to the precursor of human cr1 and murine cry the marked structural similarity between the human and murine receptors suggests functional conservation as well
E,the composition of cell surface gangliosides is largely dependent on the relative activities of golgi resident glycosyltransferases in the brain of birds and mammals complex gangliosides gm2 gm1 gd1a gd1b gt1b abound at late stages of development and in the adult due to the relatively high activities of the udp-galnaclaccergm3gd3 beta 14-n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase galnac-t and the udp-gal ga2gm2gd2 beta 1 3-galactosyltransferase gal-t2 relative to that of cmp-neuacgm3 alpha 28-sialyltransferase sial-t2 unlike brain the mature mammalian neural retina abundantly expresses the simple ganglioside gd3 in relation to complex gangliosides due to the low activity of galnac-t and gal-t2 relative to sial-t2 here we describe the isolation and characterization of a mouse gal-t2 cdna that drives the synthesis of an epitope-tagged protein of molecular mass 43 kda which was enzymatically active and localized to the golgi complex in transfected cell lines using this cdna as a probe it was found that gal-t2 is coded by a single gene located in chromosome 17 and that the coding sequence is contained in a single exon the expression of the specific gal-t2 mrna approximately 18 kb was highest in testis which also showed elevated gal-t2 activity in the postnatal neural retina gal-t2 mrna increased after day 3 maintained high levels of expression by days 4-7 and then decreased to initial values by day 10 the developmental pattern of mrna expression was temporally coincident with that of gal-t2 activity expression indicating that this enzyme is under transcriptional control in the neural retina
E,as a base for human transcriptome and functional genomics we created the full-length long japan flj collection of sequenced human cdnas we determined the entire sequence of 21243 selected clones and found that 14490 cdnas 10897 clusters were unique to the flj collection about half of them 5416 seemed to be protein-coding of those 1999 clusters had not been predicted by computational methods the distribution of gc content of nonpredicted cdnas had a peak at approximately 58 compared with a peak at approximately 42for predicted cdnas thus there seems to be a slight bias against gc-rich transcripts in current gene prediction procedures the rest of the cdnas unique to the flj collection 5481 contained no obvious open reading frames orfs and thus are candidate noncoding rnas about one-fourth of them 1378 showed a clear pattern of splicing the distribution of gc content of noncoding cdnas was narrow and had a peak at approximately 42 relatively low compared with that of protein-coding cdnas
E,the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is the pre-eminent organism for the study of basic functions of eukaryotic cells all of the genes of this simple eukaryotic cell have recently been revealed by an international collaborative effort to determine the complete dna sequence of its nuclear genome here we describe some of the features of chromosome xii
E,connexins26 and -32 are subunit proteins of gap junctions that are coexpressed in hepatocytes and several tissues but individually expressed in other cells molecular cloning of both corresponding mouse genes revealed similar genomic organization ie each gene consists of two exons with the complete coding region located in the second exon the first exon of each gene is preceded by a tata-less promoter region the promoter of the mouse cx26 gene has at least two transcription start sites and is located in a very gc-rich region which is reminiscent of promoters of house-keeping genes putative consensus sequences for a metal response element the transcription factor nfkappab and several gc-boxes were found within 600 bp upstream of the cx26 transcription start sites the promoter region of the mouse cx32 gene contains two putative binding sites for the transcription factor hnf-1 and consensus motifs for nf-1 as well as nfkappab within 680 bp upstream of the main transcription start site thus the sequence comparison of mouse cx26 and cx32 promoter regions provides hints for possible consensus elements that could control individual expression as well as common regulation of these gap junction genes in various tissues cx26 mrna is much more abundant in adult mouse skin than in adult kidney and liver where cx32 transcripts are relatively strongly expressed
E,four gastrincholecystokinin-like peptides gcck which cross-react with a specific c-terminal gastrincck antiserum have been isolated from the stomach of the marine crustacean nephrops norvegicus the molecular weight of the four peptides was estimated between 1000 and 2000 da by molecular sieving by radioimmunoassay the cross-reactivity of these peptides with human gastrin 17-i was found to be around 003 pure peptidic fractions were recovered after four successive steps of hplc amino-acid analysis suggested a similarity between the four peptides identified which may belong to a new family a limited homology between the c-terminus of one nephrops peptide and vertebrate gcck was found after sequencing two of the peptides exhibited secretagogue effects on crustacean isolated midgut glands the nephrops peptides although structurally distinct from the vertebrate gccks appear to serve similar biological functions in crustaceans
E,the fly drosophila melanogaster is one of the most intensively studied organisms in biology and serves as a model system for the investigation of many developmental and cellular processes common to higher eukaryotes including humans we have determined the nucleotide sequence of nearly all of the approximately 120-megabase euchromatic portion of the drosophila genome using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy supported by extensive clone-based sequence and a high-quality bacterial artificial chromosome physical map efforts are under way to close the remaining gaps however the sequence is of sufficient accuracy and contiguity to be declared substantially complete and to support an initial analysis of genome structure and preliminary gene annotation and interpretation the genome encodes approximately 13600 genes somewhat fewer than the smaller caenorhabditis elegans genome but with comparable functional diversity
B,the ca 22-kbp region upstream of the ddc gene encoding l-24-diaminobutyrate decarboxylase in acinetobacter baumannii was sequenced and found to contain another open reading frame of 1338 nucleotides encoding a protein with a deduced molecular mass of 47423 da analysis of the homologies observed from the deduced amino acid sequence indicated that the gene product is an enzyme belonging to subgroup ii of the aminotransferases this was first verified when examination of the crude extracts from escherichia coli transformants led to detection of a novel aminotransferase activity catalyzing the following reversible reactions l-24-diaminobutyric acid  2-ketoglutaric acid60--l-glutamic acid  l-aspartic beta-semialdehyde further confirmation was obtained when the gene was overexpressed in e coli and the corresponding protein was purified to homogeneity it catalyzed the same reactions and its n-terminal amino acid sequence was consistent with that deduced from the nucleotide sequence therefore the gene and its product were named dat and l-24-diaminobutyrate2-ketoglutarate 4-aminotransferase daba at respectively feeding experiments of a baumannii with l-u-14caspartic acid resulted in the incorporation of the label into 13-diaminopropane apparent homologs of dat and daba at were detected in other acinetobacter species by pcr amplification and western blotting these results indicate that the dat gene as well as the ddc gene participates in the synthesis of 13-diaminopropane the only diamine found in this genus however the biological role if one exists of 13-diaminopropane synthesis is unknown
E,coordination of cellular organization requires the interaction of the cytoskeletal filament systems recently several lines of investigation have suggested that transport of cellular components along both microtubules and actin filaments is important for cellular organization and function we report here on molecules that may mediate coordination between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons we have identified a 195-kd protein that coimmunoprecipitates with a class vi myosin drosophila 95f unconventional myosin cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding the 195-kd protein reveals that it is the first homologue identified of cytoplasmic linker protein clip-170 a protein that links endocytic vesicles to microtubules we have named this protein d-clip-190 the predicted molecular mass is 189 kd based on its similarity to clip-170 and its ability to cosediment with microtubules the similarity between d-clip-190 and clip-170 extends throughout the length of the proteins and they have a number of predicted sequence and structural features in common 95f myosin and d-clip-190 are coexpressed in a number of tissues during embryogenesis in drosophila in the axonal processes of neurons they are colocalized in the same particulate structures which resemble vesicles they are also colocalized at the posterior pole of the early embryo and this localization is dependent on the actin cytoskeleton the association of a myosin and a homologue of a microtubule-binding protein in the nervous system and at the posterior pole where both microtubule and actin-dependent processes are known to be important leads us to speculate that these two proteins may functionally link the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons
B,the 567-megabase genome of the plant pathogen agrobacterium tumefaciens c58 consists of a circular chromosome a linear chromosome and two plasmids extensive orthology and nucleotide colinearity between the genomes of a tumefaciens and the plant symbiont sinorhizobium meliloti suggest a recent evolutionary divergence their similarities include metabolic transport and regulatory systems that promote survival in the highly competitive rhizosphere differences are apparent in their genome structure and virulence gene complement availability of the a tumefaciens sequence will facilitate investigations into the molecular basis of pathogenesis and the evolutionary divergence of pathogenic and symbiotic lifestyles
E,we report the sequence analysis of a 10531 bp dna of saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome vii this sequence contains five complete open reading frames orfs potentially encoding proteins longer than 100 amino acids and incomplete orf encoding for the 3' part of the gcn5 gene georgakopoulos and thireos 1992 orfs g9160 and g9155 correspond to the genes eno1 holland et al 1981 and pup2 gergatsou et al 1992 respectively orf g9165 codes for a protein which shares significant homology with known proteins present in databases see below the translated sequence of orf g9170 shows 88 identity to the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase encoded by the gene 6pgd from s cerevisiae present in the swissprot data library p38720 this indicates that g9170 might code for a second 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase orf g9175 codes for a putative new member of the mitochondrial carrier family a hypothetical trnathr tgt is also present in position 6842-6913
B,thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis is a rod-shaped gram-negative anaerobic eubacterium that was isolated from a freshwater hot spring in tengchong china using a whole-genome-shotgun method we sequenced its 2689445-bp genome from an isolate mb4t genbank accession no ae008691 the genome encodes 2588 predicted coding sequences cds among them 1764 682 are classified according to homology to other documented proteins and the rest 824 cds 318 are functionally unknown one of the interesting features of the t tengcongensis genome is that 867 of its genes are encoded on the leading strand of dna replication based on protein sequence similarity the t tengcongensis genome is most similar to that of bacillus halodurans a mesophilic eubacterium among all fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes up to date computational analysis on genes involved in basic metabolic pathways supports the experimental discovery that t tengcongensis metabolizes sugars as principal energy and carbon source and utilizes thiosulfate and element sulfur but not sulfate as electron acceptors t tengcongensis as a gram-negative rod by empirical definitions such as staining shares many genes that are characteristics of gram-positive bacteria whereas it is missing molecular components unique to gram-negative bacteria a strong correlation between the g  c content of tdna and rdna genes and the optimal growth temperature is found among the sequenced thermophiles it is concluded that thermophiles are a biologically and phylogenetically divergent group of prokaryotes that have converged to sustain extreme environmental conditions over evolutionary timescale
B,a tn5-induced mutant of rhizobium leguminosarum bv viciae could not form nitrogen-fixing nodules on pea or vetch because of a lesion in electron transport to oxygen the mutant lacked spectroscopically detectable cytochromes c and aa3 no proteins containing c-type cytochrome could be identified in the mutant by heme staining of proteins fractionated on polyacrylamide gels indicating that the mutant was defective in maturation of all c-type cytochromes the tn5 mutation was determined to be located in a gene that was called cycy the cycy gene product is homologous to the thioredoxin-like protein helx involved in the assembly of c-type cytochromes in rhodobacter capsulatus and to an open reading frame from a bradyrhizobium japonicum gene cluster containing other genes involved in cytochrome c biogenesis our observations are consistent with cycy functioning as a thioredoxin that reduces cysteine residues in apocytochromes c before heme attachment
E,the rol-6 gene is one of the more than 40 loci in caenorhabditis elegans that primarily affect organismal morphology certain mutations in the rol-6 gene produce animals that have the right roller phenotype ie they are twisted into a right-handed helix the rol-6 gene interacts with another gene that affects morphology sqt-1 a left roller allele of sqt-1 acts as a dominant suppressor of a right roller allele of rol-6 the sqt-1 gene has previously been shown to encode a collagen we isolated and sequenced the rol-6 gene and found that it also encodes a collagen the rol-6 gene was identified by physical mapping of overlapping chromosomal deficiencies that cover the gene and by identification of an allele-specific restriction site alteration the amino acid sequence of the collagen encoded by rol-6 is more similar to that of the sqt-1 collagen than to any of the other ten c elegans cuticle collagen sequences compared the locations of cysteine residues flanking the gly-x-y repeat regions of rol-6 and sqt-1 are identical but differ from those in the other collagens the sequence similarities between rol-6 and sqt-1 indicate that they represent a new collagen subfamily in c elegans these findings suggest that these two collagens physically interact possibly explaining the genetic interaction seen between the rol-6 and sqt-1 genes
B,the sequence determination of the entire genome of the synechocystis sp strain pcc6803 was completed the total length of the genome finally confirmed was 3573470 bp including the previously reported sequence of 1003450 bp from map position 64 to 92 of the genome the entire sequence was assembled from the sequences of the physical map-based contigs of cosmid clones and of lambda clones and long pcr products which were used for gap-filling the accuracy of the sequence was guaranteed by analysis of both strands of dna through the entire genome the authenticity of the assembled sequence was supported by restriction analysis of long pcr products which were directly amplified from the genomic dna using the assembled sequence data to predict the potential protein-coding regions analysis of open reading frames orfs analysis by the genemark program and similarity search to databases were performed as a result a total of 3168 potential protein genes were assigned on the genome in which 145 46 were identical to reported genes and 1257 396 and 340 108 showed similarity to reported and hypothetical genes respectively the remaining 1426 450 had no apparent similarity to any genes in databases among the potential protein genes assigned 128 were related to the genes participating in photosynthetic reactions the sum of the sequences coding for potential protein genes occupies 87 of the genome length by adding rrna and trna genes therefore the genome has a very compact arrangement of protein- and rna-coding regions a notable feature on the gene organization of the genome was that 99 orfs which showed similarity to transposase genes and could be classified into 6 groups were found spread all over the genome and at least 26 of them appeared to remain intact the result implies that rearrangement of the genome occurred frequently during and after establishment of this species
E,the nucleotide sequence and derived amino acid sequence of two different beta-glucosidase cdna clones were determined one clone tre104 was identified as the cyanogenic beta-glucosidase by homology with the n-terminal and internal peptide amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme the biological function of the other beta-glycosidase tre361 is not known co-segregation of genomic restriction fragments uniquely identified by each cdna clone shows that these two genes are linked in the white clover genome both tre104 and tre361 fragments co-segregate with cyanogenic beta-glucosidase activity extensive homology was found between the white clover beta-glucosidase sequences and a group of prokaryote and mammalian beta-glycosidases this group of sequences has no homology with a separate set of beta-glucosidase genes isolated from fungi and the thermophilic bacterium clostridium thermocellum
B,clostridium perfringens is a gram-positive anaerobic spore-forming bacterium that causes life-threatening gas gangrene and mild enterotoxaemia in humans although it colonizes as normal intestinal flora of humans and animals the organism is known to produce a variety of toxins and enzymes that are responsible for the severe myonecrotic lesions here we report the complete 3031430-bp sequence of c perfringens strain 13 that comprises 2660 protein coding regions and 10 rrna genes showing pronounced low overall g  c content 286 the genome contains typical anaerobic fermentation enzymes leading to gas production but no enzymes for the tricarboxylic acid cycle or respiratory chain various saccharolytic enzymes were found but many enzymes for amino acid biosynthesis were lacking in the genome twenty genes were newly identified as putative virulence factors of c perfringens and we found a total of five hyaluronidase genes that will also contribute to virulence the genome analysis also proved an efficient method for finding four members of the two-component virrvirs regulon that coordinately regulates the pathogenicity of c perfringens clearly c perfringens obtains various essential materials from the host by producing several degradative enzymes and toxins resulting in massive destruction of the host tissues
B,background vibrio parahaemolyticus a gram-negative marine bacterium is a worldwide cause of food-borne gastroenteritis v parahaemolyticus strains of a few specific serotypes probably derived from a common clonal ancestor have lately caused a pandemic of gastroenteritis the organism is phylogenetically close to v cholerae the causative agent of cholera methods the whole genome sequence of a clinical v parahaemolyticus strain rimd2210633 was established by shotgun sequencing the coding sequences were identified by use of gambler and glimmer programs comparative analysis with the v cholerae genome was undertaken with mummer findings the genome consisted of two circular chromosomes of 3288558 bp and 1877212 bp it contained 4832 genes comparison of the v parahaemolyticus genome with that of v cholerae showed many rearrangements within and between the two chromosomes genes for the type iii secretion system ttss were identified in the genome of v parahaemolyticus v cholerae does not have these genes interpretation the ttss is a central virulence factor of diarrhoea-causing bacteria such as shigella salmonella and enteropathogenic escherichia coli which cause gastroenteritis by invading or intimately interacting with intestinal epithelial cells our results suggest that v parahaemolyticus and v cholerae use distinct mechanisms to establish infection this finding explains clinical features of v parahaemolyticus infections which commonly include inflammatory diarrhoea and in some cases systemic manifestations such as septicaemia distinct from those of v cholerae infections which are generally associated with non-inflammatory diarrhoea
B,streptomyces coelicolor is a representative of the group of soil-dwelling filamentous bacteria responsible for producing most natural antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicine here we report the 8667507 base pair linear chromosome of this organism containing the largest number of genes so far discovered in a bacterium the 7825 predicted genes include more than 20 clusters coding for known or predicted secondary metabolites the genome contains an unprecedented proportion of regulatory genes predominantly those likely to be involved in responses to external stimuli and stresses and many duplicated gene sets that may represent 'tissue-specific' isoforms operating in different phases of colonial development a unique situation for a bacterium an ancient synteny was revealed between the central 'core' of the chromosome and the whole chromosome of pathogens mycobacterium tuberculosis and corynebacterium diphtheriae the genome sequence will greatly increase our understanding of microbial life in the soil as well as aiding the generation of new drug candidates by genetic engineering
E,a mg2-dependent atpase activity has been purified from trout sperm axonemes which has properties characteristic of a dynein atpase a polyclonal antiserum prepared against the dynein heavy chains has been used to isolate dynein heavy chain dyhc cdnas from a trout testis lambda gt11 cdna expression library beta-galactosidase fusion proteins produced in lambda gt11 by these trout cdnas cross-reacted with a heterologous anti-sea urchin dynein antiserum northern blot analyses demonstrated that the rna transcripts detected have sizes 75 - 12 kb consistent with those expected for the dynein heavy chains all the dyhc cdnas encode portions of a highly unusual dna coding sequence comprised of 21 bp direct repeats the predicted open reading frame of this repeat is ileleu-his-val-ile-gln-tyr-ser and is characteristic of an extensive alpha-helical coiled-coil domain the presence of an in-frame translation termination codon indicates that this domain is located at the carboxyl-terminus of the dyhc southern blot analyses demonstrated a low if not single copy number for this gene and conservation of this domain in other vertebrates dyhc transcripts reach their highest level in testis but are also abundant in brain tissue
E,rna editing was examined in rice mitochondrial apocytochrome b cob transcripts nineteen c-u conversions were found and most of them changed the polypeptide sequence encoded by genomic dna sequence evidence for partial and excess editing was also found
B,a series of tn917lac insertions define the comg region of the bacillus subtilis chromosome comg mutants are deficient in competence and specifically in the binding of exogenous dna the genes included in the comg region are first expressed during the transition from the exponential to the stationary growth phase from nucleotide sequence information it was concluded that the comg locus contains seven open reading frames orfs several of which overlap at their termini high-resolution s1 nuclease mapping and primer extension were used to identify the 5' terminus of the comg mrna the sequence upstream from the comg start site closely resembled the consensus recognition sequence for the major b subtilis vegetative rna polymerase holoenzyme complementation analysis confirmed that the comg orf1 protein is required for the ability of competent cultures to resolve into two populations with different cell densities on renografin e r squibb 38 sons princeton nj gradients as well as for full expression of come another late competence locus the predicted comg orf1 protein showed significant similarity to the virb orf11 protein from agrobacterium tumefaciens which is probably involved in t-dna transfer the n-terminal sequences of comg orf3 and to a lesser extent the comg orf4 and orf5 proteins were similar to a class of pilin proteins from members of the genera bacteroides pseudomonas neisseria and moraxella all of the comg proteins except comg orf1 possessed hydrophobic domains that were potentially capable of spanning the bacterial membrane it is likely that these proteins are membrane associated and they may comprise part of the dna transport machinery when present in multiple copies a dna fragment carrying the comg promoter was capable of inhibiting the development of competence as well as the expression of several late com genes suggesting a role for a transcriptional activator in the expression of those genes
E,the conversion of a palindromic sequence ggtctnnnagacc in the 5'-flanking region of the murine c-fos proto-oncogene into a functional estrogen-response element by a single base change into ggtcagnnnagacc has previously been postulated nawaz et al 1993 as a possible mechanism of the induction of tumors by estrogens this attractive hypothesis has been investigated in estradiol-induced syrian hamster kidneytumors in h-301 kidney tumor cells a cell line derived from the syrian hamster tumor and in normal kidney tissue the c-fos gene is differentially regulated by a classical estrogen receptor-mediated process in tumors whereas in the acutely treated kidney estradiol induces c-fos expression independent of estrogen-receptor function in this study we identified in the 5'-flanking region of the hamster kidney c-fos gene the sequence agtccnnnagacc which closely resembled but did not appear to function as an estrogen-response element no mutations were detected in this sequence or in the 5'-flanking region of c-fos genes from three different primary tumors and from h-301 tumor cells to rule out the possibility of a low copy number of mutant alleles in a tumor sample polymerase chain reaction-based single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis was performed on 372 base pairs of the 5'-flank of the c-fos gene -367 to 5 base pairs relative to the transcription start point nine different kidney tumor dna samples and five normal kidney tissue samples controls produced an identical pattern of dna bands suggesting a lack of natural polymorphisms and mutations in this region of the c-fos gene acute treatment of hamsters with 17beta-estradiol for 6 h significantly induced renal c-fos mrna expression whereas control levels of c-fos were restored by co-treatment with estradiol and either n-acetyl-l-cysteine or alpha-naphthoflavone we concluded that the previously observed change in regulatory control of c-fos expression in kidney versus estradiol-induced tumors does not involve the creation of a functional estrogen-response element by single point mutation in the 5'-flanking region of the gene additionally c-fos expression in estradiol-treated hamster kidneys appears to be mediated by free radicals generated by the catechol metabolites of estradiol and not by the activation of any estrogen receptor
E,eclosion hormone eh is a 62-amino acid neuropeptide that initiates the ecdysis behavior of insects the eh-encoding gene of the tobacco hornworm manduca sexta was isolated by using a designed 72-mer oligonucleotide probe sequence analysis of this gene and its corresponding cdna showed that the eh gene is 78 kilobases and consists of three exons exon i is totally nontranslated exon ii contains a 26-amino acid signal peptide and amino acids 1-4 of the eh peptide and exon iii encodes the remainder of the peptide the eh gene is present in a single copy per haploid genome and transcribes an 08-kb mrna that is expressed in larval diapausing pupal and developing adult brains but not in the ventral nerve cord or in nonneural tissues in situ hybridization showed that the eh gene is expressed in two pairs of ventromedial neurosecretory cells in brains of both larvae and developing adults
E,the ras-related rho subfamily of gtp-binding proteins p21s which includes rho rac and cdc42hs is implicated in different aspects of cytoskeletal organization these proteins behave like ras p21ras in that their active gtp-bound form is inactivated by intrinsic hydrolysis of the nucleotide gamma-phosphate which can be stimulated by gtpase-activating proteins gaps we have previously shown that there is a diversity of gaps that recognize this subfamily including n-chimaerin which is enriched in the hippocampus we also detected proteins that bind these p21 proteins and seem to inhibit gtp hydrolysis we now report the characterization of a hippocampal complementary dna encoding a tyrosine kinase that specifically binds cdc42hs in its gtp-bound form this binding is mediated by a unique sequence of 47 amino acids c-terminal to an sh3 domain and inhibits both the intrinsic and gap-stimulated gtpase activity of cdc42hs our findings indicate that there may be a regulatory mechanism that sustains the gtp-bound active form of cdc42hs and which is directly linked to a tyrosine phosphorylation pathway
B,nitrosomonas europaea atcc 19718 is a gram-negative obligate chemolithoautotroph that can derive all its energy and reductant for growth from the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite nitrosomonas europaea participates in the biogeochemical n cycle in the process of nitrification its genome consists of a single circular chromosome of 2812094 bp the gc skew analysis indicates that the genome is divided into two unequal replichores genes are distributed evenly around the genome with approximately 47 transcribed from one strand and approximately 53 transcribed from the complementary strand a total of 2460 protein-encoding genes emerged from the modeling effort averaging 1011 bp in length with intergenic regions averaging 117 bp genes necessary for the catabolism of ammonia energy and reductant generation biosynthesis and co2 and nh3 assimilation were identified in contrast genes for catabolism of organic compounds are limited genes encoding transporters for inorganic ions were plentiful whereas genes encoding transporters for organic molecules were scant complex repetitive elements constitute ca 5 of the genome among these are 85 predicted insertion sequence elements in eight different families the strategy of n europaea to accumulate fe from the environment involves several classes of fe receptors with more than 20 genes devoted to these receptors however genes for the synthesis of only one siderophore citrate were identified in the genome this genome has provided new insights into the growth and metabolism of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria
E,fifteen unique chorion protein-encoding cdnas from gypsy moth have been completely sequenced these sequences are encoded by a family of genes based on pairwise similarity values of 78-100 within a 225-nt region pairwise comparisons and maximum parsimony analysis strongly support the existence of two clusters of 11 and four sequences each called noc1 and noc2 while noc2 consists of two subclusters there is little character support for subclusters within noc1 the highly localized character-state distribution on the parsimony tree in gypsy moth is reminiscent of that in bombyx mori specifically for those chorion families that have been shown to undergo gene conversion gene conversion thus becomes a reasonable explanation for the homogeneity of noc1 sequences and for their distinctness from noc2 the relationship between the two major clusters of chorion sequences in gypsy moth noc1 noc2 and bombyx mori bm alpha bm beta has been addressed through mixed-species tree construction all four groups cluster separately thus providing no direct evidence of orthologous sequences however the occurrence of gene conversion could have eliminated such evidence the relationship between the chorion gene tree and the species cladogenic event is discussed as are biases in codon usage base composition and nucleotide transformations
B,in addition to its role in the nucleoid the histone-like protein hlpa of streptococcus pyogenes is believed to act as a fortuitous virulence factor in delayed sequelae by binding to heparan sulfate-proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix of target organs and acting as a nidus for in situ immune complex formation to further characterize this protein the hlpa genes were cloned from s pyogenes s gordonii s mutans and s sobrinus using pcr amplification and sequenced the encoded hlpa protein of s pyogenes has 91 amino acids a predicted molecular mass of 9647 da an isoelectric point of 981 and 90 to 95 sequence identity with hlpa of several oral streptococci the consensus sequence of streptococcal hlpa has 69 identity with the consensus sequence of the histone-like hb protein of bacillus species oral viridans group streptococci growing in chemically defined medium at ph 68 released hlpa into the milieu during stationary phase as a result of limited cell lysis hlpa was not released by these bacteria when grown at ph 60 or below s pyogenes did not release hlpa during growth in vitro however analyses of sera from 155 pharyngitis patients revealed a strong correlation p 60 00017 between the production of antibodies to hlpa and antibodies to streptolysin o indicating that the histone-like protein is released by group a streptococci growing in vivo extracellular hlpa formed soluble complexes with lipoteichoic acid in vitro and bound readily to heparan sulfate on hep-2 cell surfaces these results support a potential role for hlpa in the pathogenesis of streptococcus-induced tissue inflammation
E,growth factors and their receptors are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and also play a key role in oncogenesis in this study a novel putative kinase receptor gene termed eph has been identified and characterized by molecular cloning its primary structure is similar to that of tyrosine kinase receptors thus far cloned and includes a cysteine-rich region in the extracellular domain however other features of the sequence distinguish the eph gene product from known receptors with tyrosine kinase activity thus the eph protein may define a new class of these molecules the eph gene is overexpressed in several human carcinomas suggesting that this gene may be involved in the neoplastic process of some tumors
E,to identify domains in the dynein heavy chain dhc required for the assembly of an inner arm dynein we characterized a new motility mutant ida2-6 obtained by insertional mutagenesis ida2-6 axonemes lack the polypeptides associated with the i1 inner arm complex recovery of genomic dna flanking the mutation indicates that the defects are caused by plasmid insertion into the dhc10 transcription unit which encodes the 1beta dhc of the i1 complex transformation with dhc10 constructs encoding 6020 of the dhc can partially rescue the motility defects by reassembly of an i1 complex containing an n-terminal 1beta dhc fragment and a full-length 1alpha dhc electron microscopic analysis reveals the location of the missing 1beta dhc motor domain within the axoneme structure these observations together with recent studies on the 1alpha dhc identify a dhc domain required for complex assembly and further demonstrate that the intermediate and light chains are associated with the stem regions of the dhcs in a distinct structural location the positioning of these subunits within the i1 structure has significant implications for the pathways that target the assembly of the i1 complex into the axoneme and modify the activity of the i1 dynein during flagellar motility
B,brucella melitensis is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes abortion in goats and sheep and malta fever in humans the genome of b melitensis strain 16m was sequenced and found to contain 3294935 bp distributed over two circular chromosomes of 2117144 bp and 1177787 bp encoding 3197 orfs by using the bioinformatics suite ergo 2487 78 orfs were assigned functions the origins of replication of the two chromosomes are similar to those of other alpha-proteobacteria housekeeping genes including those involved in dna replication transcription translation core metabolism and cell wall biosynthesis are distributed on both chromosomes type i ii and iii secretion systems are absent but genes encoding sec-dependent sec-independent and flagella-specific type iii type iv and type v secretion systems as well as adhesins invasins and hemolysins were identified several features of the b melitensis genome are similar to those of the symbiotic sinorhizobium meliloti
B,the flaa chec locus from escherichia coli is important in controlling the rotational direction of flagella during chemotaxis the locus was sequenced and a site of transcriptional initiation was determined two reading frames flaai and flaaii span the locus flaaii corresponds to certain flaa and chec mutations and has some unusual features in the predicted secondary structure flaai however has not been identified previously but a flaai deletion which produced a truncated flaai peptide in minicells clearly identified the flaai protein
E,the japanese dormouse glirulus japonicus is the only extant lineage that represents this genus and it has been classified as a single species distributed on the three main islands of japan namely honshu shikoku and kyushu however individuals collected from fukui wakayama and kochi prefectures southwestern part of japan yielded distinctly different profiles of restriction fragments of the nuclear ribosomal dna rdna spacer from those collected from yamanashi and nagano prefectures central japan the estimated sequence divergence between the two groups was 28 on average which corresponds to a putative divergence some two million years ago representing mitochondrial dna mtdna sequences 402 bases of cytochrome b gene were determined by direct sequencing and the estimated extent of the sequence divergence between the two groups was 65-7 differences between the two geographic groups were also substantial in the sequences of about 300 base-fragments from the y-linked sex-determining locus sry to assess the phylogenetic relationships between the japanese dormouse and members of the family myoxidae we compared sequences of mitochondrial 12s rrna gene of japanese dormice with those of the forest dormouse dryomys nitedula and the common dormouse muscardinus avellanarins two continental genera thought to be closely related to the genus glirulus the results showed that the sequences from japanese dormice were distinct from any sequences of the two continental species and the extent of the differences were somewhat similar to that between the rat rattus norvegicus and the hamster mesocricetus auratus
A,the complete 166-megabase pair genome sequence of an autotrophic archaeon methanococcus jannaschii and its 58- and 16-kilobase pair extrachromosomal elements have been determined by whole-genome random sequencing a total of 1738 predicted protein-coding genes were identified however only a minority of these 38 percent could be assigned a putative cellular role with high confidence although the majority of genes related to energy production cell division and metabolism in m jannaschii are most similar to those found in bacteria most of the genes involved in transcription translation and replication in m jannaschii are more similar to those found in eukaryotes
E,here we report the sequence of 569202 base pairs of saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome v analysis of the sequence revealed a centromere two telomeres and 271 open reading frames orfs plus 13 trnas and four small nuclear rnas there are two tyl transposable elements each of which contains an orf included in the count of 271 of the orfs 78 29 are new 81 30 have potential homologues in the public databases and 112 41 are previously characterized yeast genes
E,to help elucidate the function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr we have undertaken a cross-species analysis of the dna sequence which encodes this protein we have isolated and characterized the cdna of the bovine homologue of cftr the deduced amino acid sequence shows high overall identity with the published sequences from human and mouse although there is marked variability between the different potential functional domains the region around human amino acid 508 which is deleted in 70 of cystic fibrosis chromosomes is highly conserved across species of the missense cystic fibrosis mutations reported to date all of the amino acids in the normal human sequence are conserved in the bovine and mouse sequences a single amino acid encoded by the human cdna ser-434 is missing in the bovine sequence and there are two amino acids encoded by the bovine sequence which are absent in the human these all stem from in-frame 3-base omissions within the sequences in addition to the cow we amplified the dna sequences encoding a portion of the r-domain from sheep monkey rabbit and guinea pig these sequences show relatively low overall sequence identity 63 but nearly all of the potential protein kinase a and protein kinase c phosphorylation sites are conserved over all of the species examined our results suggest functional significance for certain highly conserved residues and putative domains within cftr
E,the maternally transcribed product of the drosophila easter gene is essential for the establishment of a normal dorsal-ventral pattern in embryos loss-of-function mutations in easter result in a dorsalization of the embryonic pattern while dominant gain-of-function mutations ventralize the embryonic pattern p element insertion alleles of easter were isolated and used to identify genomic and cdna clones that include the easter gene injection of in vitro-synthesized transcripts of the cdna into embryos from easter mutant females completely rescued the mutant phenotype allowing normal development this result confirmed that the cdna encodes easter and that the easter product is only required after fertilization the sequence of the cdna suggests that the product of the easter gene is an extracytoplasmic serine protease the implications of the dominant alleles of this putative protease for the mechanism of dorsal-ventral pattern formation are discussed
E,several alpha-amylase clones were identified by screening a group of 345 cdna clones derived from polyarna from gibberellic acid ga-treated barley aleurone layer cells using an alpha-amylase cdna clone that we had characterized previously as the hybridization probe the alpha-amylase clones showed differences in the distribution of restriction enzyme sites in the extent of cross hybridization and in nucleotide sequence there are at least three types of alpha-amylase clones in our collection and the alpha-amylase cdna clone reported by rogers and milliman j biol chem 1983 258 8169-8174 is a fourth type the accumulation of alpha-amylase mrnas in aleurones as a function of time after ga addition and of hormone concentration in the incubation medium was studied using different alpha-amylase cdna clone probes these studies indicate a differential control of the expression of the alpha-amylase genes by ga
B,genome sequences are available for many bacterial strains but there has been little progress in using these data to understand the molecular basis of pathogen emergence and differences in strain virulence serotype m3 strains of group a streptococcus gas are a common cause of severe invasive infections with unusually high rates of morbidity and mortality to gain insight into the molecular basis of this high-virulence phenotype we sequenced the genome of strain mgas315 an organism isolated from a patient with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome the genome is composed of 1900521 bp and it shares approximately 17 mb of related genetic material with genomes of serotype m1 and m18 strains phage-like elements account for the great majority of variation in gene content relative to the sequenced m1 and m18 strains recombination produces chimeric phages and strains with previously uncharacterized arrays of virulence factor genes strain mgas315 has phage genes that encode proteins likely to contribute to pathogenesis such as streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin a spea and spek streptococcal superantigen ssa and a previously uncharacterized phospholipase a2 designated sla infected humans had anti-spek -ssa and -sla antibodies indicating that these gas proteins are made in vivo spek and ssa were pyrogenic and toxic for rabbits serotype m3 strains with the phage-encoded spek and sla genes increased dramatically in frequency late in the 20th century commensurate with the rise in invasive disease caused by m3 organisms taken together the results show that phage-mediated recombination has played a critical role in the emergence of a new unusually virulent clone of serotype m3 gas
B,a 171812 bp nucleotide sequence between prka and addab 83 degrees to 97 degrees on the genetic map of the bacillus subtilis 168 chromosome was determined and analysed an accurate physicalgenetic map of this previously poorly described chromosomal region was constructed one hundred and seventy open reading frames orfs were identified on the dna fragment these include the previously described genes cspb glppfkd spovr phoaiv papq citra sspb prsa hpr pbpf hemehy apre comk and addab orf yhaf in this region corresponds to the glyb marker among the striking features of this region are an abundance of genes encoding putative transporter proteins several dysfunctional genes the ubiquitous hit gene and five multidrug-resistance-like genes these analyses have also revealed the existence of numerous paralogues of orfs in this region about two-thirds of the putative genes seem to have at least one paralogue in the b subtilis genome
E,six members of a multigene family encoding polypeptide constituents of the fucoxanthin chlorophyll ac protein complex from female gametophytes of the brown alga macrocystis pyrifera have been cloned and characterized the deduced amino acid sequences are very similar to those of fucoxanthin chlorophyll binding proteins fcp from the diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum and exhibit limited homology to chlorophyll ab binding cab polypeptides from higher plants the primary translation products from the m pyrifera fcp genes are synthesized as higher molecular weight precursors that are processed prior to their assembly into the fcp complex the presumed n-terminal 40-amino acid presequence of the fcp precursor polypeptide has features resembling that of a signal sequence this presequence may be required for the protein to transverse the endoplasmic reticulum that surrounds the plastid in brown algae a subsequent targeting step would be required for the protein to cross the double membrane of the plastid envelope m pyrifera fcp transcripts are of two sizes 12 and 16 kb the size difference is accounted for by the length of the 3' untranslated region which can be up to 1000 bases transcript abundance's of members of the fcp gene family are dependent on light quantity light quality or both transcript levels of one gene increased approximately five- to tenfold in thalli grown in low intensity relative to high intensity white or blue light transcripts from this gene also significantly increase in red light relative to blue light at equivalent light intensities
A,the complete 1751377-bp sequence of the genome of the thermophilic archaeon methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum deltah has been determined by a whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach a total of 1855 open reading frames orfs have been identified that appear to encode polypeptides 844 46 of which have been assigned putative functions based on their similarities to database sequences with assigned functions a total of 514 28 of the orf-encoded polypeptides are related to sequences with unknown functions and 496 27 have little or no homology to sequences in public databases comparisons with eucarya- bacteria- and archaea-specific databases reveal that 1013 of the putative gene products 54 are most similar to polypeptide sequences described previously for other organisms in the domain archaea comparisons with the methanococcus jannaschii genome data underline the extensive divergence that has occurred between these two methanogens only 352 19 of m thermoautotrophicum orfs encode sequences that are 50 identical to m jannaschii polypeptides and there is little conservation in the relative locations of orthologous genes when the m thermoautotrophicum orfs are compared to sequences from only the eucaryal and bacterial domains 786 42 are more similar to bacterial sequences and 241 13 are more similar to eucaryal sequences the bacterial domain-like gene products include the majority of those predicted to be involved in cofactor and small molecule biosyntheses intermediary metabolism transport nitrogen fixation regulatory functions and interactions with the environment most proteins predicted to be involved in dna metabolism transcription and translation are more similar to eucaryal sequences gene structure and organization have features that are typical of the bacteria including genes that encode polypeptides closely related to eucaryal proteins there are 24 polypeptides that could form two-component sensor kinase-response regulator systems and homologs of the bacterial hsp70-response proteins dnak and dnaj which are notably absent in m jannaschii dna replication initiation and chromosome packaging in m thermoautotrophicum are predicted to have eucaryal features based on the presence of two cdc6 homologs and three histones however the presence of an ftsz gene indicates a bacterial type of cell division initiation the dna polymerases include an x-family repair type and an unusual archaeal b type formed by two separate polypeptides the dna-dependent rna polymerase rnap subunits a' a b' b and h are encoded in a typical archaeal rnap operon although a second a' subunit-encoding gene is present at a remote location there are two rrna operons and 39 trna genes are dispersed around the genome although most of these occur in clusters three of the trna genes have introns including the trnapro ggg gene which contains a second intron at an unprecedented location there is no selenocysteinyl-trna gene nor evidence for classically organized is elements prophages or plasmids the genome contains one intein and two extended repeats 36 and 86 kb that are members of a family with 18 representatives in the m jannaschii genome
E,chicken embryo fibroblasts cef infected with a temperature-sensitive rous sarcoma virus rsv mutant tsny72-4 express a set of pp60v-src-induced rnas soon after shift to the permissive temperature by subtractive and differential screening we have cloned 12 of these sequences 2 of which were c-fos and krox-24 serum induced all the v-src-inducible genes tested suggesting that these genes serve roles in normal cell division and are not specific to transformation per se significantly however v-src produced prolonged and in some cases kinetically complex patterns of induction compared to serum for most of the clones phorbol 12-tetradecanoate 13-acetate tpa induced mrnas with kinetics similar to that of serum however one clone cef-4 was expressed in a biphasic manner another cef-10 was repressed by tpa at 1 hr after which this mrna was permanently induced the pattern of repression-induction of cef-10 mrna is the inverse of protein kinase c pkc activity in the cell suggesting that pkc actively represses this gene in vivo expression of cef-10 mrna is restricted predominantly to the lung a full-length cef-10 cdna encodes a 41-kda protein that has an amino-terminal signal peptide for secretion contains a markedly high number of cysteine residues and shows no sequence similarity to known proteins
E,a novel calcium-dependent serine proteinase casp secreted from malignant hamster embryo fibroblast ni 12c2 degrades extracellular matrix proteins a complementary dna encoding casp has been isolated with the use of oligonucleotide probes synthesized based on partial amino acid sequences of casp the complete amino acid sequences of casp revealed that it has a active site at the c-terminal side glu rich and proegf homologous sites are found at the n-terminal site suggesting that it is structurally similar to blood coagulation factors such as ix x and an anticoagulation factor protein c
B,shewanella oneidensis is an important model organism for bioremediation studies because of its diverse respiratory capabilities conferred in part by multicomponent branched electron transport systems here we report the sequencing of the s oneidensis genome which consists of a 4969803-base pair circular chromosome with 4758 predicted protein-encoding open reading frames cds and a 161613-base pair plasmid with 173 cdss we identified the first shewanella lambda-like phage providing a potential tool for further genome engineering genome analysis revealed 39 c-type cytochromes including 32 previously unidentified in s oneidensis and a novel periplasmic fe hydrogenase which are integral members of the electron transport system this genome sequence represents a critical step in the elucidation of the pathways for reduction and bioremediation of pollutants such as uranium u and chromium cr and offers a starting point for defining this organism's complex electron transport systems and metal ion-reducing capabilities
B,the genus xanthomonas is a diverse and economically important group of bacterial phytopathogens belonging to the gamma-subdivision of the proteobacteria xanthomonas axonopodis pv citri xac causes citrus canker which affects most commercial citrus cultivars resulting in significant losses worldwide symptoms include canker lesions leading to abscission of fruit and leaves and general tree decline xanthomonas campestris pv campestris xcc causes black rot which affects crucifers such as brassica and arabidopsis symptoms include marginal leaf chlorosis and darkening of vascular tissue accompanied by extensive wilting and necrosis xanthomonas campestris pv campestris is grown commercially to produce the exopolysaccharide xanthan gum which is used as a viscosifying and stabilizing agent in many industries here we report and compare the complete genome sequences of xac and xcc their distinct disease phenotypes and host ranges belie a high degree of similarity at the genomic level more than 80 of genes are shared and gene order is conserved along most of their respective chromosomes we identified several groups of strain-specific genes and on the basis of these groups we propose mechanisms that may explain the differing host specificities and pathogenic processes
B,we present the complete genome sequence of uropathogenic escherichia coli strain cft073 a three-way genome comparison of the cft073 enterohemorrhagic e coli edl933 and laboratory strain mg1655 reveals that amazingly only 392 of their combined nonredundant set of proteins actually are common to all three strains the pathogen genomes are as different from each other as each pathogen is from the benign strain the difference in disease potential between o157h7 and cft073 is reflected in the absence of genes for type iii secretion system or phage- and plasmid-encoded toxins found in some classes of diarrheagenic e coli the cft073 genome is particularly rich in genes that encode potential fimbrial adhesins autotransporters iron-sequestration systems and phase-switch recombinases striking differences exist between the large pathogenicity islands of cft073 and two other well-studied uropathogenic e coli strains j96 and 536 comparisons indicate that extraintestinal pathogenic e coli arose independently from multiple clonal lineages the different e coli pathotypes have maintained a remarkable synteny of common vertically evolved genes whereas many islands interrupting this common backbone have been acquired by different horizontal transfer events in each strain
B,neisseria gonorrhoeae is able to utilize iron fe from a variety of sources including transferrin tf and lactoferrin lf to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms used by gonococci to scavenge fe from tf and lf we cloned a 35 kb segment of wild-type dna that repaired the defect in tlu mutants which are unable to take up fe from either tf or lf despite exhibiting apparently normal ligand binding to the receptor nucleotide sequence determination identified three open reading frames orfs designated orf1 orf2 and orf3 which were arranged in tandem the deduced amino acid sequence of the 852 bp orf1 encoded a 28 kda protein that exhibited 26-32 identity with tonb proteins of nine other bacteria the 663 bp orf2 predicted a 24 kda protein and the 435 bp long orf3 predicted a 15 kda protein these predicted protein sequences exhibited 32-38 and 24-36 identity respectively with exbb and exbd proteins of three other bacteria thus the sequence comparison identified the orf1 orf2 and orf3 as gonococcal homologues of the e coli tonb exbb and exbd genes an insertional mutation in the tonb homologue resulted in the failure of gonococci to grow with tf lf or human haemoglobin hb as sole fe sources and in the inability to take up 55fe from tf and lf the tonb mutation did not prevent the utilization of fe from citrate ct or haemin hm binding of tf lf and hb to whole cells in a solid-phase binding assay was largely unaffected by the tonb mutation we conclude that the pathways for utilization of fe bound to tf lf and hb but not to hm or ct were dependent on the tonb system
E,the ets family of proteins is a large group of transcription factors implicated in many aspects of normal hematopoietic development as well as oncogenesis for example the tel1etv6 tel1 gene is required for normal yolk sac angiogenesis adult bone marrow hematopoiesis and is rearranged or deleted in numerous leukemias this report describes the cloning and characterization of a novel ets gene that is highly related to tel1 and is therefore called tel2 the tel2 gene consists of 8 exons spanning approximately 21 kilobases kb in human chromosome 6p21 unlike the ubiquitously expressed tel1 gene however tel2 appears to be expressed predominantly in hematopoietic tissues antibodies raised against the c-terminus of the tel2 protein were used to show that tel2 localizes to the nucleus all ets proteins can bind dna via the highly conserved ets domain which recognizes a purine-rich dna sequence with a ggaa core motif dna binding assays show that tel2 can bind the same consensus dna binding sequence recognized by tel1etv6 additionally the tel2 protein is capable of associating with itself and with tel1 in doubly transfected hela cells and this interaction is mediated through the pointed pnt domain of tel1 the striking similarities of tel2 to the oncogenic tel1 its expression in hematopoietic tissues and its ability to associate with tel1 suggest that tel2 may be an important hematopoietic regulatory protein
B,the nucleotide sequence of a 237 kb dna fragment derived from cloning a total dna digest of rhodopseudomonas capsulata sp108 was determined the dna codes for a beta-lactamase a protein showing sequence similarity to the ampr protein of enterobacter cloacae and an unidentified open reading frame hybridization experiments with a probe carrying dna from within the beta-lactamase gene suggests a chromosomal location for the coding sequences in strain sp108 and in sp109 a penicillin-sensitive revertant of sp108 in which the enzyme is not inducible a protein-sequence comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the rps capsulata beta-lactamase indicates that it is a class a enzyme and that its sequence can be aligned with those of the characterized beta-lactamases from staphylococcus aureus bacillus licheniformis and the escherichia coli plasmid r-tem enzyme with only a few insertions or deletions the corresponding dna sequence is however characteristically rhodopseudomonad suggesting that it is not a recently transposed gene
E,the fly drosophila melanogaster is one of the most intensively studied organisms in biology and serves as a model system for the investigation of many developmental and cellular processes common to higher eukaryotes including humans we have determined the nucleotide sequence of nearly all of the approximately 120-megabase euchromatic portion of the drosophila genome using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy supported by extensive clone-based sequence and a high-quality bacterial artificial chromosome physical map efforts are under way to close the remaining gaps however the sequence is of sufficient accuracy and contiguity to be declared substantially complete and to support an initial analysis of genome structure and preliminary gene annotation and interpretation the genome encodes approximately 13600 genes somewhat fewer than the smaller caenorhabditis elegans genome but with comparable functional diversity
B,the entire genome of a thermophilic unicellular cyanobacterium thermosynechococcus elongatus bp-1 was sequenced the genome consisted of a circular chromosome 2593857 bp long and no plasmid was detected a total of 2475 potential protein-encoding genes one set of rrna genes 42 trna genes representing 42 trna species and 4 genes for small structural rnas were assigned to the chromosome by similarity search and computer prediction the translated products of 56 of the potential protein-encoding genes showed sequence similarity to experimentally identified and predicted proteins of known function and the products of 34 of these genes showed sequence similarity to the translated products of hypothetical genes the remaining 10 lacked significant similarity to genes for predicted proteins in the public dna databases sixty-three percent of the t elongatus genes showed significant sequence similarity to those of both synechocystis sp pcc 6803 and anabaena sp pcc 7120 while 22 of the genes were unique to this species indicating a high degree of divergence of the gene information among cyanobacterial strains the lack of genes for typical fatty acid desaturases and the presence of more genes for heat-shock proteins in comparison with other mesophilic cyanobacteria may be genomic features of thermophilic strains a remarkable feature of the genome is the presence of 28 copies of group ii introns 8 of which contained a presumptive gene for maturasereverse transcriptase a trace of genome rearrangement mediated by the group ii introns was also observed
B,we report the complete genome sequence of the model bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato dc3000 dc3000 which is pathogenic on tomato and arabidopsis thaliana the dc3000 genome 65 megabases contains a circular chromosome and two plasmids which collectively encode 5763 orfs we identified 298 established and putative virulence genes including several clusters of genes encoding 31 confirmed and 19 predicted type iii secretion system effector proteins many of the virulence genes were members of paralogous families and also were proximal to mobile elements which collectively comprise 7 of the dc3000 genome the bacterium possesses a large repertoire of transporters for the acquisition of nutrients particularly sugars as well as genes implicated in attachment to plant surfaces over 12 of the genes are dedicated to regulation which may reflect the need for rapid adaptation to the diverse environments encountered during epiphytic growth and pathogenesis comparative analyses confirmed a high degree of similarity with two sequenced pseudomonads pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas aeruginosa yet revealed 1159 genes unique to dc3000 of which 811 lack a known function
B,an electrophoretic analysis of allelic variation at 24 enzyme loci among 170 isolates of the serovar salmonella dublin serotype 1912vigp- identified three electrophoretic types du 1 du 3 and du 4 marking three closely related clones one of which du 1 is globally distributed and was represented by 95 of the randomly selected isolates all but 1 of 114 nonmotile isolates of serotype 1912-- recovered from cattle and swine in the united states were genotypically du 1 the virulence capsular polysaccharide vi antigen is confined to clone du 3 which apparently is limited in distribution to france and great britain for all 29 isolates of du 3 positive signals were detected when genomic dna was hybridized with a probe specific for the viab region which contains the structurally determinant genes for the vi antigen and 23 of these isolates had been serologically typed as vi positive in contrast all 30 isolates of du 1 tested with the viab probe were negative these findings strongly suggest that the viab genes were recently acquired by s dublin via horizontal transfer and additive recombination the clones of s dublin are closely similar to the globally predominant clone en 1 of salmonella enteritidis serotype 1912gm- in both multilocus enzyme genotype and nucleotide sequence of the flic gene encoding phase 1 flagellin comparative sequencing of flic has revealed the molecular genetic basis for expression of the p and m flagellar epitopes by which these serovars are distinguished in the kauffmann-white serological scheme of classification
B,the nucleotide sequence of a 48-kb clai-ecori dna fragment of megaplasmid 2 of rhizobium meliloti rm2011 involved in succinoglucan eps i synthesis and nodule infection was determined four open reading frames orfs were identified on this fragment a mutational analysis revealed that these orfs represent genes that were termed exox exoy exof and exoq the locations of transposon insertions in these exo genes were determined at the nucleotide level plasmid integration mutagenesis revealed that the genes exoy exof and exoq are organized in an operon the exox gene running in opposite direction forms a monocistronic transcriptional unit the exox gene was shown to negatively influence the amount of eps i synthesized the exoy gene is coding for a membrane associated protein homologous to the c-terminal part of the xanthomonas campestris glucosyltransferase gumd and the salmonella typhimurium galactose transferase rfbp exof a probable periplasmatic protein is nearly identical to the protein encoded by orf1 of rhizobium sp strain ngr234 exoq is most probably a membrane associated protein as deduced by its hydrophobic structural features all three genes of the exoyfq operon were shown to be essential for succinoglucan synthesis and nodule infection
E,cranial neural crest cells arise from neural folds in the embryonic head and differentiate to produce most of the cartilages and bones of the skull and the somatosensory ganglia of several cranial nerves among other tissues since the molecular basis of the determination of these cells is poorly understood we have begun a search for molecules involved in signal transduction in cranial neural crest from a xenopus laevis cranial neural crest cdna bank we have cloned a cdna encoding a putative receptor tyrosine kinase which we call pagliaccio pag pag rna is present transiently in visceral arch 3 probably representing neural crest cells in this tissue pag is also expressed in the forebrain rhombomeres r3 and r5 of the hindbrain and in the pronephros based on this localized expression we propose that pag may play a role in the differentiation of cranial neural crest and other tissues
E,the fibroblast growth factors fgfs play important roles in morphogenesis angiogenesis tissue remodeling and carcinogenesis human fgf-20 has been cloned and characterized in this study fgf-20 encodes a 211-amino-acid polypeptide with the fgf-core domain a strong hydrophobic region was found in the fgf-core domain of fgf-20 however no typical n-terminal signal sequence was found in fgf-20 just as in fgf-9 and fgf-16 total amino acid identities are as follows fgf-20 vs fgf-9 716 fgf-20 vs fgf-16 662 fgf-9 vs fgf-16 724 phylogenic analysis indicated that fgf-20 fgf-9 and fgf-16 constitute a subfamily among the fgf family fgf-20 mrna of 24 kb in size was detected in colon cancer cell line sw480 by northern blot analysis lower levels of fgf-20 mrna were detected in human fetal tissues and primary cancers by cdna-pcr the nucleotide sequence of fgf-20 cdna is split into three parts in the human genome sequence of the chromosome 8p213-p22 region accession no ab020858 these results indicate that the fgf-20 gene located on human chromosome 8p213-p22 consists of three exons compared with the nucleotide sequence of fgf-20 cdna determined in this study one nucleotide deletion and one nucleotide substitution in the putative coding region were identified in human genome sequence ab020858
E,the p1 gene codes for a major rna which accumulates specifically in the fat body cells at the late third larval stage of drosophila melanogaster development under the positive control of the insect molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone the primary structure of the p1 gene and the 5' upstream flanking region to position -776 relative to the transcription start was determined by sequence analysis of a cloned genomic dna segment and two cdnas containing sequences complementary to the 5' and 3' ends of the p1 transcript the rna coding region spans 3469 nucleotides and contains a 59-base-pair intron close to its 5' end as predicted by computer analysis and established by s1 nuclease protection primer extension and cdna sequencing the predicted p1 polypeptide contains 1030 amino acids including a putative 16-amino acid signal peptide and two stretches of 12 and 11 aspartic and asparagine residues short stretches of nucleotide sequences similar to sequences located in the 5' regions of other genes expressed in the d melanogaster fat body were found in the proximal promoter and transcribed region of the p1 gene
B,the genome sequences of chlamydia trachomatis mouse pneumonitis mopn strain nigg 1 069 412 nt and chlamydia pneumoniae strain ar39 1 229 853 nt were determined using a random shotgun strategy the mopn genome exhibited a general conservation of gene order and content with the previously sequenced ctrachomatis serovar d differences between ctrachomatis strains were focused on an approximately 50 kb 'plasticity zone' near the termination origins in this region mopn contained three copies of a novel gene encoding a 3000 amino acid toxin homologous to a predicted toxin from escherichia coli o157h7 but had apparently lost the tryptophan biosyntheis genes found in serovar d in this region the c pneumoniae ar39 chromosome was 999 identical to the previously sequenced cpneumoniae cwl029 genome however comparative analysis identified an invertible dna segment upstream of the uridine kinase gene which was in different orientations in the two genomes ar39 also contained a novel 4524 nt circular single-stranded ssdna bacteriophage the first time a virus has been reported infecting c pneumoniae although the chlamydial genomes were highly conserved there were intriguing differences in key nucleotide salvage pathways cpneumoniae has a uridine kinase gene for dutp production mopn has a uracil phosphororibosyl transferase while ctrachomatis serovar d contains neither gene chromosomal comparison revealed that there had been multiple large inversion events since the species divergence of ctrachomatis and cpneumoniae apparently oriented around the axis of the origin of replication and the termination region the striking synteny of the chlamydia genomes and prevalence of tandemly duplicated genes are evidence of minimal chromosome rearrangement and foreign gene uptake presumably owing to the ecological isolation of the obligate intracellular parasites in the absence of genetic analysis comparative genomics will continue to provide insight into the virulence mechanisms of these important human pathogens
B,yersinia enterocolitica is an enterobacterium responsible for gastrointestinal syndromes its pathogenicity depends on the presence of the 70-kb pyv plasmid which directs yop secretion the yop secretion machinery consisting of the ysca-u and lcrd proteins presents some structural similarity with the flagellum assembly machinery characterized in other bacteria flagellum assembly requires sigma 28 an alternative sigma factor the region upstream of the lcrd gene resembles promoters recognized by sigma 28 suggesting that the similarity between yop secretion and flagellum assembly could extend to their regulation the chromosome of y enterocolitica also contains pathogenicity determinants such as myfa which encodes the myf antigen subunit the promoter region of myfa also resembles promoters recognized by sigma 28 in an attempt to clarify the role of sigma 28 in the expression of lcrd myfa and flagellar genes we cloned sequenced and mutagenized the flia gene encoding the sigma 28 homolog in y enterocolitica as is the case in other bacteria flia was required for motility however it was involved neither in fibrilla synthesis nor in yop secretion the flia mutant allowed us to monitor the role of motility in pathogenesis at least in the mouse model motility seemed not to be required for y enterocolitica pathogenesis
E,a genomic 38 kbp segment on the c1750 cosmid clone containing the cdc2 gene located in the left arm of chromosome ii from schizosaccharomyces pombe was sequenced the segment was found to have five previously known genes pht1 cdc2 his3 act1 and mei4 among 11 coding sequences cdss predicted by the gene finding software intronplot four cdss pi007 pi010 pi014 and pi016 had considerable similarity to 40s ribosomal protein glycosyltransferase cdc2-related protein kinase and alpha-1 2-mannosyltransferase respectively another unusually huge open reading frame orf pi011 consisting of 2233 amino acids existed having significant homology to alpha-amylase granule-bound glycogen synthase and the sz pombe ys 1110 clone product at the n-terminal middle and c-terminal regions respectively all the predicted 11 cdss were experimentally analysed by race pcr the sequencing of the race products revealed that there were two small overlaps at the 3' untranslated regions utrs between pi004 and pi005 17 bp and between pi007 and pi008 2 bp the distances between 5' end of the 5'utr and the putative translation initiation codon varied from 10 to 302 nucleotides nt among the nine cdss successfully analysed by 5'-race the expression level of each cds on this clone was determined among the 16 genes on this clone the previously determined genes pht1 cdc2 his3 and act1 were found to be most highly expressed finally cdnas of all the newly identified genes were detected by race proving the actual expression of these genes the nucleotide sequence has been submitted to the embl database under accession no ab004534
E,arginase ec 3531 catalyzes the last step of the urea cycle in the liver of ureotelic animals inherited deficiency of the enzyme results in argininemia an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hyperammonemia to facilitate investigation of the enzyme and gene structures and to elucidate the nature of the mutation in argininemia we isolated cdna clones for human liver arginase oligodt-primed and random primer human liver cdna libraries in lambda gt11 were screened using isolated rat arginase cdna as a probe two of the positive clones designated lambda harg6 and lambda harg109 contained an overlapping cdna sequence with an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 322 amino acid residues predicted mr 34732 a 5'-untranslated sequence of 56 base pairs a 3'-untranslated sequence of 423 base pairs and a polya segment arginase activity was detected in escherichia coli cells transformed with the plasmid carrying lambda harg6 cdna insert rna gel blot analysis of human liver rna showed a single mrna of 16 kilobases the predicted amino acid sequence of human liver arginase is 87 and 41 identical with those of the rat liver and yeast enzymes respectively there are several highly conserved segments among the human rat and yeast enzymes
B,the nucleotide sequence of a 14-kilobase dna fragment containing the alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase gene of enterobacter aerogenes was determined the sequence contains an entire protein-coding region of 780 nucleotides which encodes an alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase of 260 amino acids the dna sequence coding for alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase was placed under the control of the alcohol dehydrogenase i promoter of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae in a plasmid capable of autonomous replication in both s cerevisiae and escherichia coli brewer's yeast cells transformed by this plasmid showed alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase activity and were used in laboratory-scale fermentation experiments these experiments revealed that the diacetyl concentration in wort fermented by the plasmid-containing yeast strain was significantly lower than that in wort fermented by the parental strain these results indicated that the alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase activity produced by brewer's yeast cells degraded alpha-acetolactate and that this degradation caused a decrease in diacetyl production
B,two novel type i catechol 12-dioxygenases inducible on aniline media were isolated from acinetobacter lwoffii k24 although the two purified enzymes cd i1 and cd i2 had similar intradiol cleavage activities they showed different substrate specificities for catechol analogs physicochemical properties and amino acid sequences two cata genes cata1 and cata2 encoding by cd i1 and cd i2 respectively were isolated from the a lwoffii k24 genomic library by using colony hybridization and pcr two dna fragments containing the cata1 and cata2 genes were located on separate regions of the chromosome they contained open reading frames encoding 334- and 304-kda proteins the amino acid sequences of the two proteins matched well with previously determined sequences interestingly further analysis of the two dna fragments revealed the locations of the catb and catc genes as well moreover the dna fragment containing cata1 had a cluster of genes in the order catb1-catc1-cata1 while the catb2-cata2-catc2 arrangement was found in the cata2 dna fragment these results may provide an explanation of the different substrate specificities and physicochemical properties of cd i1 and cd i2
E,a comparison of the genes encoding the cd1 leucocyte differentiation antigens in man and mouse shows important differences which prompted us to analyze the cd1 genes of the rabbit we have found that the rabbit genome contains multiple cd1 loci upon cloning and sequencing one of these loci was found to encode the known rabbit cd1-like antigen r-ta and to be closely related to the human cd1b gene which is absent in the mouse while a second rabbit gene is closely related to both the human r3 and the mouse cd1 genes the data reinforce the notion of the existence of two classes of cd1 genes one of which is conserved in all species while the other albeit also evolutionarily old has been deleted in mice as well as in other rodents
B,the detection of bacteria using pcr is a well-established diagnostic technique however conventional pcr requires the use of dna primer oligomers that are specific to the target organism and as a consequence a sample can only be tested for the presence of that specific target a significant advantage would be to probe a sample for the presence of any bacteria followed by identification to achieve this it is necessary to identify a dna sequence common to all bacteria here we demonstrate that such a sequence may be that encoding the major cold-shock proteins using two universal pcr primer oligomers from conserved regions of these gene homologues we have amplified a 200 base-pair dna sequence from more than 30 diverse gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria including representatives from the genera aeromonas bacillus citrobacter enterobacter enterococcus escherichia klebsiella lactobacillus lactococcus listeria pediococcus photobacterium proteus salmonella shigella staphylococcus streptococcus and yersinia sequence analysis of the amplified products confirmed a high level of dna homology significantly however there are sufficient nucleotide variations to allow the unique allocation of each amplified sequence to its parental bacterium
E,sequence was obtained from a cdna clone designated erd1 isolated from a cdna library of 1-hour-dehydrated plants of arabidopsis thaliana l the clone 3150 bp contains an open reading frame of 946 amino acid residues with greater than 34 sequence identity to the regulatory subunit of the clp atp-dependent protease in escherichia coli and contains a putative chloroplast-targeting signal at the n-terminus southern blot analysis suggested the presence of additional erd1-related genes in a thaliana the expression of erd1 gene was strongly induced by dehydration-stress but not by heat- cold- or heavy-metal-stress in addition erd1 gene-expression was not strongly affected by treatment with plant growth regulators such as auxin cytokinin abscisic acid and gibberellic acid or by starvation-stress for 10 hours
B,the complete nucleotide sequence of the genome of a symbiotic bacterium bradyrhizobium japonicum usda110 was determined the genome of b japonicum was a single circular chromosome 9105828 bp in length with an average gc content of 641 no plasmid was detected the chromosome comprises 8317 potential protein-coding genes one set of rrna genes and 50 trna genes fifty-two percent of the potential protein genes showed sequence similarity to genes of known function and 30 to hypothetical genes the remaining 18 had no apparent similarity to reported genes thirty-four percent of the b japonicum genes showed significant sequence similarity to those of both mesorhizobium loti and sinorhizobium meliloti while 23 were unique to this species a presumptive symbiosis island 681 kb in length which includes a 410-kb symbiotic region previously reported by gttfert et al was identified six hundred fifty-five putative protein-coding genes were assigned in this region and the functions of 301 genes including those related to symbiotic nitrogen fixation and dna transmission were deduced a total of 167 genes for transposases104 copies of insertion sequences were identified in the genome it was remarkable that 100 out of 167 transposase genes are located in the presumptive symbiotic island dna segments of 4 to 97 kb inserted into trna genes were found at 14 locations in the genome which generates partial duplication of the target trna genes these observations suggest plasticity of the b japonicum genome which is probably due to complex genome rearrangements such as horizontal transfer and insertion of various dna elements and to homologous recombination
B,the carr region encodes a light-inducible promoter a negative regulator of the promoter and a trans-acting activator that controls the light-inducible myxococcus xanthus carotenoid biosynthesis regulon dna sequence analysis revealed downstream of the promoter three translationally coupled genes carq carr and cars sequencing of mutations demonstrated that carr encoded the negative regulator and was an integral membrane protein mutant construction and sequencing revealed that cars was the trans-acting activator and that carq was a positive regulator of the promoter neither gene encodes proteins with known sequence-specific dna-binding motifs the sequence of the light-inducible promoter region identified by primer extension analysis showed similarity to the consensus sequence of the escherichia coli stress response 'heat-shock' promoters
B,leprosy a chronic human neurological disease results from infection with the obligate intracellular pathogen mycobacterium leprae a close relative of the tubercle bacillus mycobacterium leprae has the longest doubling time of all known bacteria and has thwarted every effort at culture in the laboratory comparing the 327-megabase mb genome sequence of an armadillo-derived indian isolate of the leprosy bacillus with that of mycobacterium tuberculosis 441 mb provides clear explanations for these properties and reveals an extreme case of reductive evolution less than half of the genome contains functional genes but pseudogenes with intact counterparts in m tuberculosis abound genome downsizing and the current mosaic arrangement appear to have resulted from extensive recombination events between dispersed repetitive sequences gene deletion and decay have eliminated many important metabolic activities including siderophore production part of the oxidative and most of the microaerophilic and anaerobic respiratory chains and numerous catabolic systems and their regulatory circuits
E,the b locus of the phytopathogenic fungus ustilago maydis encodes a multiallelic recognition function that controls the ability of the fungus to form a dikaryon and complete the sexual stage of the life cycle the b locus has at least 25 alleles and any combination of two different alleles brought together by mating between haploid cells allows the fungus to cause disease and undergo sexual development within the plant an open reading frame of 410 amino acids has been shown to specify a polypeptide responsible for the activity of the b1 allele and comparisons of the predicted amino acid sequences for 6 b alleles allowed identification of variable and constant regions within the coding region of the gene haploid strains carrying a null mutation at the b locus created by gene disruption are viable but fail to interact with formerly compatible strains to give an infectious dikaryon analysis of mutants carrying a null allele indicated that the products of different alleles of the b locus combine to form a new regulatory activity and that this activity directly or indirectly turns on the pathway leading to sexual development and pathogenesis
B,in the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp pcc 6803 photosynthetic electron transport from the cytochrome bf complex to photosystem i can be mediated by cytochrome c553 or plastocyanin the concentration of copper in the growth medium determines which protein is synthesized to investigate the role of cytochrome c553 in photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport we cloned the petj gene encoding cytochrome c553 from synechocystis 6803 and determined its nucleotide sequence the 360-base pair open reading frame encodes an 85-amino acid mature protein predicted molecular mass  8742 da with a 35-amino acid presequence two mutants were constructed one in which the petj gene for cytochrome c553 was deleted and another in which the pete gene for plastocyanin was insertionally inactivated the cytochrome c553 deletion mutant m109 grew photoautotrophically even in the absence of copper that prevented the synthesis of plastocyanin as did the plastocyanin-deficient mutant m114 grown in the presence of copper that prevented the synthesis of cytochrome c553 the m109 strain exhibited photosynthetic electron transport rates similar to those of wild-type cells when grown under conditions that prevented the synthesis of plastocyanin moreover in m109 cells grown without copper cytochrome f was completely photooxidized in less than 10 ms by photosystem i these observations show that electrons can be transferred from the cytochrome bf complex to photosystem i in the absence of both cytochrome c553 and plastocyanin additionally the m109 cells exhibited dark respiration rates comparable with those of wild-type cells indicating that cytochrome c553 is not obligately required for respiratory electron transport in synechocystis 6803
E,we have identified 52 novel human cadherin-like genes organized into three closely linked clusters comparison of the genomic dna sequences with those of representative cdnas reveals a striking genomic organization similar to that of immunoglobulin and t cell receptor gene clusters the n-terminal extracellular and transmembrane domains of each cadherin protein are encoded by a distinct and unusually large exon these exons are organized in a tandem array by contrast the c-terminal cytoplasmic domain of each protein is identical and is encoded by three small exons located downstream from the cluster of n-terminal exons this unusual organization has interesting implications regarding the molecular code required to establish complex networks of neuronal connections in the brain and the mechanisms of cell-specific cadherin-like gene expression
B,the nucleotide sequence of the entire genome of a filamentous cyanobacterium anabaena sp strain pcc 7120 was determined the genome of anabaena consisted of a single chromosome 6413771 bp and six plasmids designated pcc7120alpha 408101 bp pcc7120beta 186614 bp pcc7120gamma 101965 bp pcc7120delta 55414 bp pcc7120epsilon 40340 bp and pcc7120zeta 5584 bp the chromosome bears 5368 potential protein-encoding genes four sets of rrna genes 48 trna genes representing 42 trna species and 4 genes for small structural rnas the predicted products of 45 of the potential protein-encoding genes showed sequence similarity to known and predicted proteins of known function and 27 to translated products of hypothetical genes the remaining 28 lacked significant similarity to genes for known and predicted proteins in the public dna databases more than 60 genes involved in various processes of heterocyst formation and nitrogen fixation were assigned to the chromosome based on their similarity to the reported genes one hundred and ninety-five genes coding for components of two-component signal transduction systems nearly 25 times as many as those in synechocystis sp pcc 6803 were identified on the chromosome only 37 of the anabaena genes showed significant sequence similarity to those of synechocystis indicating a high degree of divergence of the gene information between the two cyanobacterial strains
B,almost all aphid species homoptera insecta have 60-80 huge cells called bacteriocytes within which are round-shaped bacteria that are designated buchnera these bacteria are maternally transmitted to eggs and embryos through host generations and the mutualism between the host and the bacteria is so obligate that neither can reproduce independently buchnera is a close relative of escherichia coli but it contains more than 100 genomic copies per cell and its genome size is only a seventh of that of e coli here we report the complete genome sequence of buchnera sp strain aps which is composed of one 640681-base-pair chromosome and two small plasmids there are genes for the biosyntheses of amino acids essential for the hosts in the genome but those for non-essential amino acids are missing indicating complementarity and syntrophy between the host and the symbiont in addition buchnera lacks genes for the biosynthesis of cell-surface components including lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids regulator genes and genes involved in defence of the cell these results indicate that buchnera is completely symbiotic and viable only in its limited niche the bacteriocyte
E,except for the two acidic chains beta a2 and beta a4 the primary structures of all bovine beta-crystallins have previously been elucidated either by direct protein sequencing or prediction from cdna sequencing both beta a2 and beta a4 were found to be synthesized in half-year-old calf lenses and are therefore likely to be present in a cdna bovine library constructed from mrna isolated from lenses of that age a large number of cdna clones was screened with all available crystallin actin vimentin and lens membrane protein mp26 probes and finally with a randomly primed mrna probe clones positive for the latter but negative for known lens proteins were isolated and sequenced beta a2 comprising 197 aa and beta a4 comprising 209 aa were identified both proteins have a conserved two-domain structure and an n-terminal extension which is variable a three-dimensional model of the structure of beta a4 was made based on the coordinates of one subunit from the beta b2 dimer which has recently been solved using x-ray diffraction techniques the resulting heterodimer structure together with the compiled bovine beta-crystallin sequences was used to indicate those regions of the sequences which distinguish acidic from basic beta-crystallins with a view to defining structural features necessary for subunit recognition in beta-crystallin aggregates with the aid of the present data the complete evolutionary tree of the bovine beta-crystallin family has been constructed which confirms the early separation of the genes encoding the three acidic and the three basic beta-crystallins
A,background in many respects archaea are much more like eukaryotes than prokaryotes with respect to the conservation of many of the components involved in transcription translation and dna replication so far only a few dna polymerases with structures similar to those of eukaryotic dna polymerase a have been found in archaea the identification and characterization of all the dna polymerases of one archaeon would add considerably to our knowledge of the basic mechanisms of dna replication in these organisms results we have identified a novel dna polymerase composed of two proteins dp1 and dp2 with molecular weights of 69294 da and 143161 da respectively in the hyperthermophilic archaeon pyrococcus furiosus and have cloned the corresponding genes which are tandemly arranged on the pyrococcus genome no significant sequence homology was found between these two proteins and other known dna polymerases the pol genes were transcribed as part of a single operon that additionally contained genes homologous to the cdc18cdc6 and dmc1rad51 family of proteins we purified the pyrococcus dna polymerase from escherichia coli strains expressing the cloned genes and characterized its activity it possesses strong 3' -- 5' exonucleolytic activity and has a template-primer preference which is characteristic of a replicative dna polymerase conclusion in p furiosus we identified a second dna polymerase encoded by two genes neither of which display significant homology to any other known dna polymerase both the enzymatic properties of the enzyme and the gene organization raise the possibility that this enzyme might be the replicative dna polymerase of p furiosus
B,a novel enzyme arylalkyl acylamidase which shows a strict specificity for n-acetyl arylalkylamines but not acetanilide derivatives was purified from the culture broth of pseudomonas putida sc2 the purified enzyme appeared to be homogeneous as judged by native and sdspage the enzyme has a molecular mass of approximately 150 kda and consists of four identical subunits the purified enzyme catalyzed the hydrolysis of n-acetyl-2-phenylethylamine to 2-phenylethylamine and acetic acid at the rate of 625 mumolmin-1mg-1 at 30 degrees c it also catalyzed the hydrolysis of various n-acetyl arylalkylamines containing a benzene or indole ring and acetic acid arylalkyl esters the enzyme did not hydrolyze acetanilide n-acetyl aliphatic amines n-acetyl amino acids n-acetyl amino sugars or acylthiocholine the apparent km for n-acetylbenzylamine n-acetyl-2-phenylethylamine and n-acetyl-3-phenylpropylamine are 41 mm 031 mm and 16 mm respectively the purified enzyme was sensitive to thiol reagents such as ag2so4 hgcl2 and p-chloromercuribenzoic acid and its activity was enhanced by divalent metal ions such as zn2 mg2 and mn2
B,we report a molecular genetic analysis of the region immediately upstream from the escherichia coli mutl dna repair gene at 948 min an open reading frame ending 9 bp upstream from the start of mutl corresponds to a 48 kda polypeptide detected previously in minicells the predicted amino acid sequence of this 48 kda polypeptide shows homology to the major n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase autolysin of bacillus subtilis a known amidase of bacillus licheniformis and the product of a salmonella typhimurium gene that maps near 50 min insertions in this upstream gene which we named amib or in mutl did not affect cell shape or viability however overexpression of the amib polypeptide caused cell lysis hypersensitivity to osmotic shock and treatment with water and temporary autolysis by low levels of antibiotics which are all consistent with amib acting as a cell-wall hydrolase analysis of chromosomal transcription demonstrated that amib forms a complex operon with mutl and two additional upstream genes mutl transcripts also originated from an internal promoter designated pmutl located in amib 312 bp upstream from the translational start of mutl together these results suggest that e coli contains a second amidase possibly involved in cell-wall hydrolysis septation or recycling and that transcription of this amidase is directly linked to a gene central for dna repair
E,the genes encoding the rabbit 5ht1d alpha and 5ht1d beta receptors have been cloned the deduced amino acid sequence of these receptors shows 91-92 amino acid sequence identity with their human homologues and similar high sequence identity with homologues from other species the receptors were transiently expressed in cos-7 cells and exhibit a pharmacological profile closely resembling their human homologues including a higher affinity of ketanserin for the 5-ht1d alpha subtype however sumatriptan had a lower affinity for both the rabbit receptors compared to their human counterparts this may be accounted for by differences between the primary amino acid sequences of these species homologues
E,complete nucleotide sequencing shows that the plastid genome of epifagus virginiana a nonphotosynthetic parasitic flowering plant lacks all genes for photosynthesis and chlororespiration found in chloroplast genomes of green plants the 70028-base-pair genome contains only 42 genes at least 38 of which specify components of the gene-expression apparatus of the plastid moreover all chloroplast-encoded rna polymerase genes and many trna and ribosomal protein genes have been lost since the genome is functional nuclear gene products must compensate for some gene losses by means of previously unsuspected import mechanisms that may operate in all plastids at least one of the four unassigned protein genes in epifagus plastid dna must have a nongenetic and nonbioenergetic function and thereby serve as the reason for the maintenance of an active genome many small insertions in the epifagus plastid genome create tandem duplications and presumably arose by slippage mispairing during dna replication the extensive reduction in genome size in epifagus reflects an intensification of the same processes of length mutation that govern the amount of noncoding dna in chloroplast genomes remarkably this massive pruning occurred with a virtual absence of gene order change
E,while only two gamma-crystallins have been identified in the human eye lens molecular studies indicate that the human gamma-crystallins are encoded in a multigene family comprising at least seven closely related members sequence analysis of five of these genes has suggested that three gamma 1-2 g3 and g4 are potentially active while two g1 psi and g2 psi correspond to closely related pseudogenes here we report on the detailed structure of a sixth gamma-crystallin gene g5 and our results obtained with transient expression assays to characterize both the promoter activity and translation products of five members of the gene family we show that 5'-flanking sequences of g1 psi and g2 psi lacked detectable promoter activity while the corresponding sequences of g3 g4 and g5 were able to direct high levels of expression of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene in primary lens epithelia but not in cultures of nonlens origin detailed sequence comparisons indicated that active genes contained several conserved sequence tracts 5' of the tata box which may constitute functional elements of a lens-specific gamma-crystallin promoter expression of the gamma-crystallin coding sequences from the human metallothionein iia promoter in nonlens cells facilitated characterization of the polypeptides encoded by individual gamma-genes and in future studies should permit comparison of these proteins with distinct gamma-crystallins in the human lens
E,we previously reported that annexin v promoted the survival of cultured rat neocortical neurons in an effort to elucidate the mechanism underlying this neurotrophic activity of annexin v we have attempted to identify the target or binding proteins of annexin v in neuronal cells herein we screened an embryonic day 17 rat brain cdna library by western blot using glutathione s-transferase-annexin v fusion protein as a probe and then isolated four clones showing binding to annexin v in a ca2 - and phospholipid-dependent manner although these cdnas encoded different polypeptides all four polypeptides shared the unique feature of containing highly hydrophilic stretches with high lys glu and ser contents deduced amino acid sequences of two clones showed high homology with human x-linked helicase2 xh2 and dna cytosine-5 methyltransferase dmtase sequences whereas the other two were not related to any known peptide sequence these results suggest that xh2 and dmtase are candidates for annexin v-binding proteins and thus may mediate the biological activity of annexin v
E,a pcdnai adult rat kidney complementary dna cdna library was screened using a sheep 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 11 beta hsd-2 probe and the isolated clones were sequenced the 5'-end of the cdna was determined by 5'-rapid amplification of cdna ends the rat 11 beta hsd-2 cdna is 1864 base pair bp long it consists of a 5'-untranslated region of 126 bp an open reading frame of 1203 bp and a 3'-untranslated region of 535 bp the predicted protein contains 400 amino acid residues with a calculated mol wt of 43700 the rat 11 beta hsd-2 protein sequence is 85 homologous to human 11 beta hsd-2 and 76 to sheep 11 beta hsd-2 expression of 11 beta hsd-2 messenger rna by northern blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was high in kidney distal colon and adrenal and lower in the lung hypothalamus hippocampus and midbrain the rat 11 beta hsd-2 was transiently transfected into modified chinese hamster ovary cells cells transfected with the 11 beta hsd-2 cdna converted corticosterone into 11-dehydrocorticosterone conversion of corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone was nad dependent and had a km of 101 - 21 nm in conclusion we have cloned a rat nad-dependent 11 beta hsd with tissue distribution and kinetic characteristics suggesting that it could play a significant role in mineralocorticoid receptor selectivity
E,we describe the isolation of cdna clones encoding a p34cdc2 homologue from a higher plant zea mays maize a full-length cdna clone cdc2zma was isolated sequenced and shown to complement a cdc28 mutation in saccharomyces cerevisiae comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the maize p34cdc2 protein with other homologues showed that it was 64 identical to human p34cdc2 and 63 identical to schizosaccharomyces pombe and s cerevisiae p34cdc2 proteins studies of expression of the maize cdc2 genes by northern blot analysis indicated a correlation between the abundance of cdc2 mrna and the proliferative state of the tissue southern blot analysis as well as isolation of another cdna clone cdc2zmb which is 96 identical to cdc2zma indicates that maize has multiple cdc2 genes
B,the complete nucleotide sequences of the coma and comb loci of bacillus subtilis were determined the products of these genes are required for the development of competence in b subtilis and for the expression of late-expressing competence genes the major 5' termini of both the coma and comb transcripts were determined the inferred promoters of both coma and comb contained sequences that were similar to those found at the -10 and -35 regions of promoters that are used by sigma a-rna polymerase the primary form of this enzyme in vegetative cells the comb gene was located approximately 3 kilobase pairs upstream of the coma gene and encoded a 409-amino-acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 46693 the coma locus contained two open reading frames orfs and comb contained one orf the predicted amino acid sequence of the coma orf1 gene product consisted of 214 amino acids with an aggregate molecular weight of 24132 the orf1 product was required for competence while orf2 which was cotranscribed with orf1 and encoded a predicted protein of 126 amino acids was not the predicted protein sequence of the coma orf1 gene product was found to be similar to that of several members of the effector class of procaryotic signal transducers the c-terminal portion of the predicted coma sequence contained a possible helix-turn-helix motif which is characteristic of dna-binding proteins coma orf1 was cloned on a multicopy plasmid and was shown to complement the competence-deficient phenotype caused by the coma124 insertion of tn917lac also the presence of coma orf1 in multiple copies interfered with sporulation anti-peptide antibodies raised to the predicted product of coma orf1 reacted strongly with a single protein band of about 24000 daltons in immunoblots the possible roles of multiple signal transduction systems in triggering the development of competence are discussed
B,c-552 and split-alpha c-555 cytochromes from bacillus azotoformans are classified on the basis of partial sequence information the haem-containing polypeptides are postulated to be structurally equivalent to small ic and id subclass cytochromes found in purple bacteria
E,the conversion of 3 beta-hydroxy-5-ene steroids by the enzyme complex 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenasedelta 5-delta 4 isomerase 3 beta-hsd is an essential step in the biosynthesis of all classes of hormonal steroids we report the characterization of two types of cdna clones encoding rat 3 beta-hsd isolated from a rat ovary lambda gt11 cdna library with a human 3 beta-hsd cdna probe both type i and type ii cdnas encode proteins of 372 amino acids having 94 homology transient expression of the type i and the type ii 3 beta-hsd cdnas in hela human cervical carcinoma cells reveals that both proteins possess 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase as well as delta 5-delta 4 isomerase activities for both delta 5-pregnene and delta 5-androstene precursors although the type i 3 beta-hsd protein is more active than the type ii rna blot analysis using type i 3 beta-hsd cdna identifies major mrna transcripts of 17 kilobase in rat ovary testis and adrenal polya rna rnase protection assay using type i- and type ii-specific crna probes revealed the existence of the two corresponding mrnas in male and female rat adrenals and gonads as well as in female adipose tissue while only type i mrna is present in male and female kidney moreover in situ hybridization performed using type-specific labeled 24-mer oligonucleotides confirms that type i is the major mrna species in the ovary and further indicates that both mrna species have a similar cellular distribution in the ovarian tissue with the highest level of expression found in corpora lutea immunoblot analysis using polyclonal antibodies raised against purified human placental 3 beta-hsd identified a single 42-kda band in rat ovary testis and adrenal which agrees with the calculated molecular masses of 41911 and 42150 daltons for the type i and ii proteins respectively determination of 3 beta-hsd enzymatic activity using 14cpregnenolone and 14cdehydroepiandrosterone as substrates shows that 3 beta-hsd activity is present not only in the gonads and adrenals of animals of both sexes but also in many peripheral tissues including adipose tissue mammary gland kidney liver prostate seminal vesicle uterus skin brain heart thymus pancreas lung and spleen the present data indicate the existence of two mrnas encoding rat 3 beta-hsd and their differential tissular distribution in both steroidogenic and peripheral tissuesabstract truncated at 400 words
A,the formate dehydrogenase-encoding fdhcab operon and flanking genes have been cloned and sequenced from methanobacterium thermoformicicum z-245 fdh transcription was shown to be initiated 21 bp upstream from fdhc although most fdh transcripts terminated or were processed between fdhc and fdha the resulting fdhc fdhab and fdhcab transcripts were present at all growth stages in cells growing on formate but were barely detectable during early exponential growth on h2 plus co2 the levels of the fdh transcripts did however increase dramatically in cells growing on h2 plus co2 coincident with the decrease in the growth rate and the onset of constant methanogenesis that occurred when culture densities reached an optical density at 600 nm of approximately 05 the mth transcript that encodes the h2-dependent methenyl-h4 mpt reductase mth and the frh and mvh transcripts that encode the coenzyme f420-reducing frh and nonreducing mvh hydrogenases respectively were also present in cells growing on formate consistent with the synthesis of three hydrogenases mth frh and mvh in the absence of exogenously supplied h2 reducing the h2 supply to m thermoformicicum cells growing on h2 plus co2 reduced the growth rate and ch4 production but increased frh and fdh transcription and also increased transcription of the mtd mer and mcr genes that encode enzymes that catalyze steps 4 5 and 7 respectively in the pathway of co2 reduction to ch4 reducing the h2 supply to a level insufficient for growth resulted in the disappearance of all methane gene transcripts except the mcr transcript which increased regions flanking the fdhcab operon in m thermoformicicum z-245 were used as probes to clone the homologous region from the methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum deltah genome sequencing revealed the presence of very similar genes except that the genome of m thermoautotrophicum a methanogen incapable of growth on formate lacked the fdhcab operon
E,the complete nucleotide sequence of the chloroplast genome 150613 bp from the unicellular green alga chlorella vulgaris c-27 has been determined the genome contains no large inverted repeat and has one copy of rrna gene cluster consisting of 16s 23s and 5s rrna genes it contains 31 trna genes of which the trnaleugag gene has not been found in land plant chloroplast dnas analyzed so far sixty-nine protein genes and eight orfs conserved with those found in land plant chloroplasts have also been found the most striking is the existence of two adjacent genes homologous to bacterial genes involved in cell division mind and mine which are arranged in the same order in escherichia coli this finding suggests that the mechanism of chloroplast division is similar to bacterial division other than mind and mine homologues genes encoding ribosomal proteins l5 l12 l19 and s9 rpl5 rpl12 rpl19 and rps9 a chlorophyll biosynthesis mg chelating subunit chli and elongation factor ef-tu tufa which have not been reported from land plant chloroplast dnas are present in this genome however many of the new chloroplast genes recently found in red and brown algae have not been found in c vulgaris furthermore this algal species possesses two long orfs related to ycf1 and ycf2 that are exclusively found in land plants these observations suggest that c vulgaris is closer to land plants than to red and brown algae
B,the phopphoq two-component system regulates salmonella typhimurium genes that are essential to bacterial virulence and survival within macrophages the best characterized of these phop-activated genes pag is pagc which encodes a 188-amino-acid envelope protein w s pulkkinen and s i miller j bacteriol 17386-93 1991 we here report the identification of four genes pagd enve msga and envf located 5' to pagc each gene is transcribed from its own promoter two of which msga and pagd were defined by primer extension analysis three of these genes pagd enve and envf are predicted to encode envelope proteins the pagd gene is transcribed in a direction opposite from that of and adjacent to pagc and is positively regulated by phopphoq transposon insertions within pagd and msga attenuate bacterial virulence and survival within macrophages however deletion of pagd has no effect on virulence the product of the envf gene is predicted to be a lipoprotein on the basis of the presence of a consensus lipid attachment site the low g  c content of these genes and the homology of msga to shigella plasmid dna suggest that this region may have been acquired by horizontal transmission
E,the peptide phe-met-arg-phe-nh2 fmrfamide and structurally related peptides are present both in invertebrate and vertebrate nervous systems although they constitute a major class of invertebrate peptide neurotransmitters the molecular structure of their receptors has not yet been identified in neurons of the snail helix aspersa as well as in aplysia bursting and motor neurons fmrfamide induces a fast excitatory depolarizing response due to direct activation of an amiloride-sensitive na channel we have now isolated a complementary dna from helix nervous tissue when expressed in xenopus oocytes it encodes an fmrfamide-activated na channel fanach that can be blocked by amiloride the corresponding protein shares a very low sequence identity with the previously cloned epithelial na channel subunits and caenorhabditis elegans degenerins but it displays the same overall structural organization to our knowledge this is the first characterization of a peptide-gated ionotropic receptor
B,the primary structure of a 31-kilobase e6 or e3 segment carrying colicin and related genes was determined plasmid cole6-ct14 showed striking homology to cole3-ca38 throughout this segment including homology to the secondary immunity gene imme8 downstream of the e6 or e3 immunity gene the cole3-ca38 and cole6-ct14 sequences however contained an exceptional hot spot region encoding both the colicin-active domain rnase region and the immunity protein reflecting their different immunity specificities on the other hand some chimeric plasmids were constructed through homologous recombination between colicin e3 and cloacin df13 operons the resulting plasmids were deduced to produce chimeric colicins with a colicin e3-type n-terminal part a cloacin df13-type c-terminal-active domain and the df13 immunity protein the killing spectra of the chimeric colicins and the immunities of the plasmids were identical to those of colicin e6 and cole6-ct14 respectively showing that the colicin e6 immunity specificity is completely equivalent to that of cloacin df13 nevertheless colicin e6 has been found to show a sequence diversity from cloacin df13 almost to the same extent as that from colicin e3 in their rnase and immunity regions indicating that only a small number of amino acids defines the immunity specificity for discrimination between colicins e3 and e6 or cloacin df13
E,to study the interaction between the primate lentiviruses simian immunodeficiency virus siv and human immunodeficiency virus hiv and the cd4 receptor we have cloned and sequenced the cd4 molecule from six non-human primate species african green monkeys three subspecies sabeus pytherethrus aethiops sooty mangabeys patas monkeys chimpanzees rhesus macaques and pig-tail macaques molecular cdna clones representing cd4 mrna were generated from total rna from peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc by polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification including reverse transcriptase in initial reactions followed by two rounds of nested amplifications primer sequences were selected from regions conserved among human and rodent cd4 genes alignments of deduced amino acid sequences revealed interesting findings first all of the primate cd4 molecules were about 90 identical to the human cd4 sequence except the chimpanzee 98 second two macaques or two african green monkey subspecies were as distanly related as the human versus chimpanzee sequences third relatedness of cd4 sequences could not be predicted on the basis of geographic origin asian vs african finally upon sequencing several clones from individual monkeys a low degree of sequence variation nucleotide substitutions deletions and insertions was found within the same animal and in case of sooty mangabeys two distict populations of cd4 molecules were present within three of four individuals the distinguishing features involved eight amino acid changes including a single lysine deletion relative to a primate consensus sequence in the first complementary-determing region of v1j1 these two cd4 populations were present also at the genomic dna level and may arrive from the two chromosomal alleles suggesting the existence of distinct sooty mangabey subspecies overall the v1j1 and to a lesser extent v2j2 were the most variable regions among the sequences examined by construction and expression in mammalian cell lines of cd4 chimeras in which these regions of the human cd4 were replaced by those of the african green monkey and pig-tail macaques a higher molecular mass of the cd4 chimeras were obtained in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggesting that the additional n-linked glycosylation sites present in these monkey cd4 are also used
E,mitochondrial oxidation of long-chain fatty acids provides the majority of the energy required for cardiac functioning several proteins including the integral membrane protein fatp fatty acid-transport protein are being implicated in the process of myocardial fatty acid uptake to further characterize the role of fatp in rat myocardial fatty acid utilization cdna encoding rat fatp was cloned the inferred amino acid sequence indicates that rat fatp is highly homologous 97 with its murine equivalent moreover rodent fatps share several well-conserved regions with putative counterparts found in yeast and nematode given the large evolutionary distance between these species these regions might be important for protein function the predicted membrane topology of rat fatp is discussed
E,we have isolated a 3845 base-pair cdna bngluas encoding a bovine glutamate transporter bovine glast by screening a bovine retina cdna library with an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to conserved regions of known glutamate transporters the cdna sequence predicted a protein of 542 amino acids and displayed 96 and 97 amino acid identity with the rat glastglut-1 and human glast respectively expression of the bovine glast in xenopus oocytes revealed na-dependent 14cl-glutamate uptake and electrogenic glutamate uptake
V,the nucleotide sequence of t4 genes 55 alpha gt 47 and 46 was determined by a combination of 'classical' procedures and a shotgun approach small dna fragments generated by frequent cleavage with restriction enzymes or by sonication of restriction fragments were cloned in phage m13 vectors and sequenced by the dideoxy method the positions of the genes were determined by marker rescue between the corresponding t4 amber mutants and the cloned t4 dna fragments used in the sequencing experiments the sequence gives an insight into the organization of this 71-kb early region of the t4 genome and shows that genetically 'silent' portions within this region are not void of genetic information
E,we isolated a membrane-bound metallopeptidase dine damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase by differential display pcr using rat normal and axotomized hypoglossal nuclei the most marked properties of dine were neuron-specific expression and a striking response to axonal injury in both the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system for instance cranial and spinal nerve transection ischemia corpus callosum transection and colchicine treatment increased dine mrna expression in the injured neurons whereas kainate-induced hyperexcitation immobilization and osmotic stress failed to up-regulate dine mrna expression of dine in cos cells partially inhibited c2-ceramide-induced apoptosis probably because of the activation of antioxidant enzymes such as cuzn-superoxide dismutase mn-superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase through the proteolytic activity of dine these data provide insight into the mechanism of how injured neurons protect themselves against neuronal death
E,cutin monomers generated by the low levels of constitutively expressed cutinase induce high levels of cutinase that can help pathogenic fungi to penetrate into the host through the cuticle whose major structural polymer is cutin we cloned three highly homologous cutinase genes cut1 cut2 and cut3 from fusarium solani f pisi nectria haematococca amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of cut1 and cut23 matched with that of the peptides from cutinase 1 and cutinase 2 respectively isolated from f solani pisi grown on cutin as the sole carbon source induction of beta-glucuronidase gene fused to the promoters of the cutinases integrated into f solani pisi genome indicates that cut2 is constitutively expressed and induced under starvation whereas cut1 is highly induced by cutin monomers a palindrome binding protein pbp previously cloned binds only to palindrome 1 of cut1 promoter but not palindrome 1 of cut23 which contains two base substitutions pbp is thought to interfere with the binding of ctf1 alpha the transcription factor involved in induction to cut1 promoter and thus keep cut1 gene repressed until induced by cutin monomers because pbp cannot bind palindrome 1 of cut2 this gene is not repressed ctf1 alpha does not transactivate cut2 promoter a new cys6zn2 motif-containing transcription factor ctf1 beta that binds palindrome 2 was cloned and sequenced in yeast ctf1 beta transactivates cut2 promoter but not cut1 promoter unless its palindrome 1 is mutated unlike ctf1 alpha which transactivates cut1 thus ctf1 beta is involved in the constitutive expression of cut2 that causes production of low levels of cutin monomers that strongly induce cut1 using ctf1 alpha as the transcription factor
A,the complete 166-megabase pair genome sequence of an autotrophic archaeon methanococcus jannaschii and its 58- and 16-kilobase pair extrachromosomal elements have been determined by whole-genome random sequencing a total of 1738 predicted protein-coding genes were identified however only a minority of these 38 percent could be assigned a putative cellular role with high confidence although the majority of genes related to energy production cell division and metabolism in m jannaschii are most similar to those found in bacteria most of the genes involved in transcription translation and replication in m jannaschii are more similar to those found in eukaryotes
E,an abundant 58-kda p58 homodimeric and hexameric microsomal membrane protein has been biochemically characterized and localized to tubulo-vesicular elements at the endoplasmic reticulum-golgi interface and the cis-golgi cisternae in pancreatic acinar cells lahtinen u dahllf b and saraste j 1992 j cell sci 103 321-333 here we report the purification of p58 by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and the cloning and sequencing of the rat and part of the xenopus laevis cdnas the rat cdna encodes a 517-amino acid protein having a putative signal sequence a transmembrane domain close to the c terminus and a short cytoplasmic tail the c-terminal tail contains a double-lysine motif kkff known to mediate retrieval of proteins from the golgi back to the endoplasmic reticulum the rat p58 sequence was found to be 89 identical with those of ergic-53 and mr60 two previously identified human membrane proteins strong homology with the frog sequence was also observed indicating high evolutionary conservation overexpression of c-myc-tagged p58 resulted in accumulation of the protein both in the endoplasmic reticulum and in an apparently enlarged golgi complex as well as its leakage to the plasma membrane immunolocalization using antibodies raised against a lumenal peptide stained the total cellular pool of p58 while anti-tail peptide antibodies detected p58 only in a restricted golgi region this suggests that the c-terminal tail of p58 located in the endoplasmic reticulum and transport intermediates is hidden but becomes exposed when the protein reaches the golgi complex
V,since the e3 region of human adenoviruses codes for a series of proteins that are probably involved in viral pathogenesis the nucleotide sequence for a 36-kilobase dna fragment in the corresponding region map units 77 through 89 of the mouse adenovirus type 1 genome has been determined analysis of the sequence revealed that the genes for the fiber and for the precursor to the hexon-associated protein pviii that usually flank the e3 region are well conserved however many of the open reading frames contained in the e3 region of human adenoviruses between the pviii and the fiber genes were absent from the mouse adenovirus type 1 genome
B,the genome of the bacterium borrelia burgdorferi b31 the aetiologic agent of lyme disease contains a linear chromosome of 910725 base pairs and at least 17 linear and circular plasmids with a combined size of more than 533000 base pairs the chromosome contains 853 genes encoding a basic set of proteins for dna replication transcription translation solute transport and energy metabolism but like mycoplasma genitalium it contains no genes for cellular biosynthetic reactions because b burgdorferi and m genitalium are distantly related eubacteria we suggest that their limited metabolic capacities reflect convergent evolution by gene loss from more metabolically competent progenitors of 430 genes on 11 plasmids most have no known biological function 39 of plasmid genes are paralogues that form 47 gene families the biological significance of the multiple plasmid-encoded genes is not clear although they may be involved in antigenic variation or immune evasion
E,we cloned and sequenced the two actin-related proteins arps present in the profilin-binding complex of acanthamoeba machesky l m s j atkinson c ampe j vandekerckhove and t d pollard 1994 j cell biol 127107-115 the sequence of arp2 is more similar to other arp2s than to actin while the sequence of arp3 is more similar to other arp3s than to actin phylogenetic analysis of all known arps demonstrates that most group into three major families which are likely to be shared across all eukaryotic phyla together with conventional actins the arps form a larger family distinct from structurally related atpases such as hsp70's and sugar kinases atomic models of the arps based on their sequences and the structure of actin provide some clues about function both arps have atoms appropriately placed to bind atp and divalent cation arp2 but not arp3 has a conserved profilin-binding site neither arp has the residues required to copolymerize with actin but an arp heterodimer present in the profilin-binding complex might serve as a pointed end nucleus for actin polymerization both acanthamoeba arps are soluble in cell homogenates and both are concentrated in the cortex of acanthamoeba the cellular concentrations are 19 microm arp2 and 51 microm arp3 substoichiometric to actin 200 microm but comparable to many actin-binding proteins
B,pseudomonas putida g7 exhibits chemotaxis to naphthalene but the molecular basis for this was not known a new gene nahy was found to be cotranscribed with meta cleavage pathway genes on the nah7 catabolic plasmid for naphthalene degradation the nahy gene encodes a 538-amino-acid protein with a membrane topology and a c-terminal region that resemble those of chemotaxis transducer proteins a p putida g7 nahy mutant grew on naphthalene but was not chemotactic to this aromatic hydrocarbon the protein nahy thus appears to function as a chemoreceptor for naphthalene or a related compound the presence of nahy on a catabolic plasmid implies that chemotaxis may facilitate biodegradation
E,pep5 mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae accumulate inactive precursors to the vacuolar hydrolases the pep5 gene was isolated from a genomic dna library by complementation of the pep5-8 mutation deletion analysis localized the complementing activity to a 33-kb dna fragment dna sequence analysis of the pep5 gene revealed an open reading frame of 1029 codons with a calculated molecular mass for the encoded protein of 117403 d deletiondisruption of the pep5 gene did not kill the cells the resulting strains grow very slowly at 37 degrees the disruption mutant showed greatly decreased activities of all vacuolar hydrolases examined including pra prb cpy and the repressible alkaline phosphatase apparently normal precursors forms of the proteases accumulated in pep5 mutants as did novel forms of prb antigen antibodies raised to a fusion protein that contained almost half of the pep5 open reading frame allowed detection by immunoblot of a protein of relative molecular mass 107 kd in extracts prepared from wild-type cells cell fractionation showed the pep5 gene product is enriched in the vacuolar fraction and appears to be a peripheral vacuolar membrane protein
E,the national institutes of health mammalian gene collection mgc program is a multiinstitutional effort to identify and sequence a cdna clone containing a complete orf for each human and mouse gene ests were generated from libraries enriched for full-length cdnas and analyzed to identify candidate full-orf clones which then were sequenced to high accuracy the mgc has currently sequenced and verified the full orf for a nonredundant set of 9000 human and 6000 mouse genes candidate full-orf clones for an additional 7800 human and 3500 mouse genes also have been identified all mgc sequences and clones are available without restriction through public databases and clone distribution networks see httpmgcncinihgov
E,we report sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b 1146 bp and 12s rrna 961 bp genes as well as the nuclear protamine p1 608 bp gene from 13 species representing all four genera of the dasyurid marsupial subfamily sminthopsinae mitochondrial sequences are partitioned into five categories three codon positions in cytochrome b and stems and loops in 12s rrna with distinct substitution rates transition biases and base compositions we extract estimates of these biases from the sequences and employ them to calculate two overall distances based on the dnaml model phylogenetic analyses using distance and parsimony methods yield trees with different topologies for mtdna and protamine these trees are compatible with respect to highly resolved nodes but incompatible with respect to length differences in a parsimony framework the tree from combined-data analysis is dominated by the larger data set mtdna the balance of evidence favors a basal separation of planigale from other sminthopsines within planigale pl maculata is sister to the remaining species although the precise intergeneric affinities of antechinomys are unresolved a laniger does not appear to be part of the genus sminthopsis as suggested by morphological data the 12s rrna resolves ningaui ridei and n yvonnae as sister species
V,the nucleotide sequence of the genomic rna of narcissus mosaic virus nmv was deduced from a set of cdna clones and by direct sequencing of rna the genome with a length of 6955 nucleotides excluding the 3'polya tail contains six open reading frames orfs with the capacity to code for polypeptides of more than 10k with mr values of 186284 25845 13998 11059 26097 and 10519 the first five of these putative proteins show considerable homology to similar proteins encoded by the rnas of potato virus x pvx 6435 nucleotides and white clover mosaic virus wclmv 5845 nucleotides the sixth orf is completely overlapped by the mr 26097 coat protein cistron and has some homology with a similar orf in wclmv rna the difference in length of the rnas of nmv pvx and wclmv is due to a non-homologous domain of variable length in the central region of the 5'-proximal orf of the three viruses
B,the dna sequence of a 2254 kilobase segment of the escherichia coli k-12 genome is described here from 760 to 815 minutes on the genetic map this brings the total of contiguous sequence from the ecoli genome project to 7251 kb 760 to 928 minutes we found 191 putative coding genes orfs of which 72 genes were previously known and 110 of which remain unidentified despite literature and similarity searches seven new genes--arse arsf arsg tref xylr xylg and xylh--were identified as well as the previously mapped pit and dcta genes the arrangement of proposed genes relative to possible promoters and terminators suggests 90 potential transcription units other features include 19 rep elements 95 computer-predicted bends 50 chi sites and one grey hole thirty-one putative signal peptides were found including those of thirteen known membrane or periplasmic proteins one trna gene prok and two insertion sequences is5 and is150 are located in this segment the genes in this region are organized with equal numbers oriented with or against replication
E,the genomic structure of murine fibromodulin was determined and its age-related expression and distribution were characterized in knee epiphyses with decorin studied for reference fibromodulin as well as decorin have roles in collagen fibrillogenesis both in vitro and in vivo the murine fibromodulin gene fmod was similar with that in other species with three exons and 86 of the translated sequence in exon 2 the 27 kb long cdna contains an open reading frame of 1131 nt fibromodulin mrna levels were highest in tissues rich in fibrillar collagens type i or type ii during growth the distribution of fibromodulin mrna was similar with that of type ii collagen with the highest levels between 5 days and 1 month of age thereafter the expression of type ii collagen declined to a level near the detection limit whereas the fibromodulin expression decreased less markedly to a level of approx 35 of maximum and remained constant throughout the rest of the observation period in contrast decorin mrna levels were the highest in old animals pericellular deposition of fibromodulin was strong around the late-hypertrophic chondrocytes of the secondary ossification centre and in the growth plate in young epiphyses both fibromodulin and decorin were found interterritorially mainly in the uncalcified and deep-calcified cartilage in the old mice calcified cartilage became enriched with regard to fibromodulin while in contrast decorin deposition diminished particularly near the tidemark in the subchondral bone trabeculae decorin was found in the endosteum of growing but not in the mature epiphyses differences in the expression and distribution profiles suggest different roles for fibromodulin and decorin in the regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis maintenance of the fibril organization and matrix mineralization as fibromodulin is deposited closer to cells than decorin it may have a primary role in collagen fibrillogenesis whereas decorin might be involved in the maintenance of fibril structures in the interterritorial matrix
B,the 2272351-base pair genome of neisseria meningitidis strain mc58 serogroup b a causative agent of meningitis and septicemia contains 2158 predicted coding regions 1158 537 of which were assigned a biological role three major islands of horizontal dna transfer were identified two of these contain genes encoding proteins involved in pathogenicity and the third island contains coding sequences only for hypothetical proteins insights into the commensal and virulence behavior of n meningitidis can be gleaned from the genome in which sequences for structural proteins of the pilus are clustered and several coding regions unique to serogroup b capsular polysaccharide synthesis can be identified finally n meningitidis contains more genes that undergo phase variation than any pathogen studied to date a mechanism that controls their expression and contributes to the evasion of the host immune system
E,during its reproductive period the epididymis of the lizard lacerta vivipara produces large amount of proteins among which l proteins are very prominent components l proteins have been characterized as an androgen dependent protein family composed of 9 elements of identical mw and different phi an epididymal cdna library was performed and a cdna clone c73 was isolated using a specific anti l immunoserum we tested the tissue specificity and the androgen dependency of this clone in different physiological and experimental conditions by dot-blot analysis the aminoacid deduced sequence of the c73 clone revealed that it strictly corresponds to the nh2 terminal sequence of the liv element of the family it consists of a 151 amino acids mature protein with a 172 kda mw that present homologies with a rat epididymal protein supposed to be a retinoic acid binding protein
A,we determined and annotated the complete 22-megabase genome sequence of pyrobaculum aerophilum a facultatively aerobic nitrate-reducing hyperthermophilic topt  100 degrees c crenarchaeon clues were found suggesting explanations of the organism's surprising intolerance to sulfur which may aid in the development of methods for genetic studies of the organism many interesting features worthy of further genetic studies were revealed whole genome computational analysis confirmed experiments showing that p aerophilum and perhaps all crenarchaea lack 5' untranslated regions in their mrnas and thus appear not to use a ribosome-binding site shine-dalgarno-based mechanism for translation initiation at the 5' end of transcripts inspection of the lengths and distribution of mononucleotide repeat-tracts revealed some interesting features for instance it was seen that mononucleotide repeat-tracts of gs or cs are highly unstable a pattern expected for an organism deficient in mismatch repair this result together with an independent study on mutation rates suggests a mutator phenotype
E,the national institutes of health mammalian gene collection mgc program is a multiinstitutional effort to identify and sequence a cdna clone containing a complete orf for each human and mouse gene ests were generated from libraries enriched for full-length cdnas and analyzed to identify candidate full-orf clones which then were sequenced to high accuracy the mgc has currently sequenced and verified the full orf for a nonredundant set of 9000 human and 6000 mouse genes candidate full-orf clones for an additional 7800 human and 3500 mouse genes also have been identified all mgc sequences and clones are available without restriction through public databases and clone distribution networks see httpmgcncinihgov
E,as part of our continuing efforts to accumulate information on the coding region of unidentified human genes we newly determined the sequences of 40 cdna clones of human cell line kg-1 which correspond to relatively long and nearly full-length transcripts and predicted the coding sequences of the corresponding genes named kiaa0161 to 0200 the average size of the cdna clones analyzed was approximately 50 kb a computer search of the sequences in public databases indicated that the sequences of 20 genes were unrelated to any reported genes while the remaining 20 genes carried sequences which show some similarities to known genes among the genes in the latter category kiaa0167 contained a zn-finger motif with significant structural similarity to that of the yeast transcription factor gcs1 and kiaa0189 was classified into the rhogap gene family stretches of typical cag gln repeats which were often correlated with genetic disorders were found in kiaa0181 and kiaa0192 another novel repeat composed of alternating arg and glu was identified in kiaa0182 northern hybridization analysis demonstrated that 10 genes are expressed in a cell- or tissue-specific manner
E,in this study we describe the cloning and tissue expression of equine calcitonin ct calcitonin-gene related peptide cgrp-i and cgrp-ii cdna we also describe a novel divergent form of cgrp cgrp-i equine ct has greatest homology 85 to human rat and mouse subgroups of calcitonins equine cgrp-i has low homology 6059 to cgrps of other species the signal and n-terminal peptides for equine ct and cgrp-i were identical indicating that these peptides are encoded by a gene equivalent to the human calc-i gene equine cgrp-ii has 80 homology to chicken human rat ovine swine and bovine cgrps the homology between equine cgrp-i and cgrp-ii is low 56 the high homology of equine cgrp-ii and the low homology of equine cgrp-i to cgrp in other species were unexpected findings northern blot analysis revealed that ct mrna expression was restricted to the thyroid gland however rt-pcr revealed that ct mrna expression was also present in the pituitary gland and in the liver cgrp-i and cgrp-ii mrna expression was present in several regions of the nervous system and other tissues of neuroectodermal origin an unexpected finding was cgrp-i expression in the kidney by both northern analysis and by rt-pcr based on these results ct gene expression in the horse was not restricted to the thyroid gland and ct may be important in regulating pituitary cell function cgrps are widely expressed in tissues of the central and peripheral nervous system information from this study will be valuable to study the role of ct cgrp-i and cgrp-ii in equine health and disease
B,the sequence determination of the entire genome of the synechocystis sp strain pcc6803 was completed the total length of the genome finally confirmed was 3573470 bp including the previously reported sequence of 1003450 bp from map position 64 to 92 of the genome the entire sequence was assembled from the sequences of the physical map-based contigs of cosmid clones and of lambda clones and long pcr products which were used for gap-filling the accuracy of the sequence was guaranteed by analysis of both strands of dna through the entire genome the authenticity of the assembled sequence was supported by restriction analysis of long pcr products which were directly amplified from the genomic dna using the assembled sequence data to predict the potential protein-coding regions analysis of open reading frames orfs analysis by the genemark program and similarity search to databases were performed as a result a total of 3168 potential protein genes were assigned on the genome in which 145 46 were identical to reported genes and 1257 396 and 340 108 showed similarity to reported and hypothetical genes respectively the remaining 1426 450 had no apparent similarity to any genes in databases among the potential protein genes assigned 128 were related to the genes participating in photosynthetic reactions the sum of the sequences coding for potential protein genes occupies 87 of the genome length by adding rrna and trna genes therefore the genome has a very compact arrangement of protein- and rna-coding regions a notable feature on the gene organization of the genome was that 99 orfs which showed similarity to transposase genes and could be classified into 6 groups were found spread all over the genome and at least 26 of them appeared to remain intact the result implies that rearrangement of the genome occurred frequently during and after establishment of this species
E,the molecular mechanisms regulating the amount of dietary cholesterol retained in the body as well as the body's ability to exclude selectively other dietary sterols are poorly understood an average western diet will contain about 250-500 mg of dietary cholesterol and about 200-400 mg of non-cholesterol sterols about 50-60 of the dietary cholesterol is absorbed and retained by the normal human body but less than 1 of the non-cholesterol sterols are retained thus there exists a subtle mechanism that allows the body to distinguish between cholesterol and non-cholesterol sterols in sitosterolemia a rare autosomal recessive disorder affected individuals hyperabsorb not only cholesterol but also all other sterols including plant and shellfish sterols from the intestine the major plant sterol species is sitosterol hence the name of the disorder consequently patients with this disease have very high levels of plant sterols in the plasma and develop tendon and tuberous xanthomas accelerated atherosclerosis and premature coronary artery disease we previously mapped the stsl locus to human chromosome 2p21 and further localized it to a region of less than 2 cm bounded by markers d2s2294 and d2s2291 m-hl et al manuscript submitted we now report that a new member of the abc transporter family abcg5 is mutant in nine unrelated sitosterolemia patients
E,a cdna clone subclone b previously isolated from the human parasite entamoeba histolytica was characterized dna sequence analysis of subclone b identified the dna as that encoding apoferredoxin e histolytica ferredoxin cdna contains unusually short 5' and 3' noncoding regions of 9 and 25 nucleotides respectively a genomic ferredoxin clone was isolated from e histolytica dna and comparison of genomic and cdna sequences revealed that the ferredoxin gene is unspliced the deduced amino acid sequence of e histolytica ferredoxin resembles clostridial type of ferredoxins and shows an arrangement of cysteines characteristic for the coordination of 24fe-4s centres of interest is the absence of an aromatic amino acid in the n-terminal region of the protein a feature which is conserved in clostridial ferredoxins southern blot analysis of three different e histolytica strains 200nih rahman and hm-1imss demonstrated the presence of a family of at least two ferredoxin genes one of these genes is marked by restriction length polymorphisms in different strains of e histolytica
E,large-scale systematic sequencing has generally depended on the availability of an ordered library of large-insert bacterial or viral genomic clones for the organism under study the generation of these large insert libraries and the location of each clone on a genome map is a laborious and time-consuming process in an effort to overcome these problems several groups have successfully demonstrated the viability of the whole-genome random 'shotgun' method in large-scale sequencing of both viruses and prokaryotes here we report the sequence of saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome ix determined in part by a whole-chromosome 'shotgun' and describe the particular difficulties encountered in the random 'shotgun' sequencing of an entire eukaryotic chromosome analysis of this sequence shows that chromosome ix contains 221 open reading frames orfs of which approximately 30 have been sequenced previously this chromosome shows features typical of a small saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome
E,the immunoglobulin superfamily is a diverse group of proteins that are involved in various aspects of cell surface recognition here we report the characterization of amalgam ama a gene in the antennapedia complex ant-c of d melanogaster that exhibits amino acid similarity to vertebrate neural cell adhesion molecules and other members of the immunoglobulin superfamily the putative 333 amino acid ama protein consists of a signal sequence three immunoglobulin-like domains and a short slightly hydrophobic carboxy-terminal region antibodies against the ama protein reveal that it accumulates on the surface of various mesodermal and neural cells during embryogenesis the function of this protein remains elusive as no mutations have been recovered for ama during saturation ems mutagenesis of this chromosomal region
B,here we determine the complete genomic sequence of the gram negative gamma-proteobacterium vibrio cholerae el tor n16961 to be 4033460 base pairs bp the genome consists of two circular chromosomes of 2961146 bp and 1072314 bp that together encode 3885 open reading frames the vast majority of recognizable genes for essential cell functions such as dna replication transcription translation and cell-wall biosynthesis and pathogenicity for example toxins surface antigens and adhesins are located on the large chromosome in contrast the small chromosome contains a larger fraction 59 of hypothetical genes compared with the large chromosome 42 and also contains many more genes that appear to have origins other than the gamma-proteobacteria the small chromosome also carries a gene capture system the integron island and host 'addiction' genes that are typically found on plasmids thus the small chromosome may have originally been a megaplasmid that was captured by an ancestral vibrio species the v cholerae genomic sequence provides a starting point for understanding how a free-living environmental organism emerged to become a significant human bacterial pathogen
E,a 92 kb segment of the maxi-circle of trypanosoma brucei mitochondrial dna contains the genes for cytochrome c oxidase subunits i and ii coxi and coxii and seven unassigned reading frames urfs the genes for coxi and coxii display considerable homology at the aminoacid level 38 and 25 respectively to the corresponding genes in fungal and mammalian mtdna the only striking point of divergence being an unusually high cysteine content about 45 the reading frame coding for cytochrome c oxidase subunit ii is discontinuous the c-terminal portion of about 40 aminoacids is present in the dna-sequence in a -1 reading frame with respect to the n-terminal moiety urf5 8 and 10 show a low but distinct homology about 20 to mammalian mitochondrial urf-1 4 and 5 respectively in urf5 the first aug is found at codon 145 whereas extensive homology to mammalian urf-1 sequences occurs upstream of this position the possibility exists that uug can serve as an initiator codon urf7 and urf9 have a highly unusual aminoacid composition and do not possess aug or uug initiator codons these urfs probably do not have a protein-coding function the segment does not contain conventional trna genes
B,an approach for genome analysis based on sequencing and assembly of unselected pieces of dna from the whole chromosome has been applied to obtain the complete nucleotide sequence 1830137 base pairs of the genome from the bacterium haemophilus influenzae rd this approach eliminates the need for initial mapping efforts and is therefore applicable to the vast array of microbial species for which genome maps are unavailable the h influenzae rd genome sequence genome sequence database accession number l42023 represents the only complete genome sequence from a free-living organism
B,the biogenesis of the caulobacter crescentus polar flagellum requires the expression of more than 48 genes which are organized in a regulatory hierarchy the flbo locus is near the top of the hierarchy and consequently strains with mutations in this locus are nonmotile and lack the flagellar basal body complex in addition to the motility phenotype mutations in this locus also cause abnormal cell division complementing clones restore both motility and normal cell division sequence analysis of a complementing subclone revealed that this locus encodes at least two proteins that are homologs of the salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli flagellar proteins flil and flim flim is thought to be a switch protein and to interface with the flagellum motor the c crescentus flil and flim genes form an operon that is expressed early in the cell cycle tn5 insertions in the flim gene prevent the transcription of class ii and class iii flagellar genes which are lower in the regulatory hierarchy the start site of the flilm operon lies 166 bp from the divergently transcribed flacbd operon that encodes several basal body genes sequence comparison of the flil transcription start site with those of other class i genes flas and flao revealed a highly conserved 29-bp sequence in a potential promoter region that differs from sigma 70 sigma 54 sigma 32 and sigma 28 promoter sequences suggesting that at least three class i genes share a unique 5' regulatory region
A,the complete 1751377-bp sequence of the genome of the thermophilic archaeon methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum deltah has been determined by a whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach a total of 1855 open reading frames orfs have been identified that appear to encode polypeptides 844 46 of which have been assigned putative functions based on their similarities to database sequences with assigned functions a total of 514 28 of the orf-encoded polypeptides are related to sequences with unknown functions and 496 27 have little or no homology to sequences in public databases comparisons with eucarya- bacteria- and archaea-specific databases reveal that 1013 of the putative gene products 54 are most similar to polypeptide sequences described previously for other organisms in the domain archaea comparisons with the methanococcus jannaschii genome data underline the extensive divergence that has occurred between these two methanogens only 352 19 of m thermoautotrophicum orfs encode sequences that are 50 identical to m jannaschii polypeptides and there is little conservation in the relative locations of orthologous genes when the m thermoautotrophicum orfs are compared to sequences from only the eucaryal and bacterial domains 786 42 are more similar to bacterial sequences and 241 13 are more similar to eucaryal sequences the bacterial domain-like gene products include the majority of those predicted to be involved in cofactor and small molecule biosyntheses intermediary metabolism transport nitrogen fixation regulatory functions and interactions with the environment most proteins predicted to be involved in dna metabolism transcription and translation are more similar to eucaryal sequences gene structure and organization have features that are typical of the bacteria including genes that encode polypeptides closely related to eucaryal proteins there are 24 polypeptides that could form two-component sensor kinase-response regulator systems and homologs of the bacterial hsp70-response proteins dnak and dnaj which are notably absent in m jannaschii dna replication initiation and chromosome packaging in m thermoautotrophicum are predicted to have eucaryal features based on the presence of two cdc6 homologs and three histones however the presence of an ftsz gene indicates a bacterial type of cell division initiation the dna polymerases include an x-family repair type and an unusual archaeal b type formed by two separate polypeptides the dna-dependent rna polymerase rnap subunits a' a b' b and h are encoded in a typical archaeal rnap operon although a second a' subunit-encoding gene is present at a remote location there are two rrna operons and 39 trna genes are dispersed around the genome although most of these occur in clusters three of the trna genes have introns including the trnapro ggg gene which contains a second intron at an unprecedented location there is no selenocysteinyl-trna gene nor evidence for classically organized is elements prophages or plasmids the genome contains one intein and two extended repeats 36 and 86 kb that are members of a family with 18 representatives in the m jannaschii genome
E,we have cloned and sequenced novel cdnas that encode human and murine dnase ii the acidic deoxyribonuclease sequence analysis predicts that hudnase ii contains an n-terminal signal sequence and that mature dnase ii has 344 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 38 032 da dnase ii is a novel enzyme with no homologies to proteins of known function surprisingly c elegans appears to possess a family of dnase ii homologs unlike dnase i-like enzymes that have tissue-specific expression patterns hudnase ii is ubiquituously expressed at low levels when hudnase ii is expressed in human 293 cells we observe secretion of a novel 42-44 kda glycoprotein approximately 20-30 of recombinant human dnase ii activity is secreted in this system the secreted enzyme possesses dna hydrolytic activity and shares biochemical properties with purified dnase ii obtained from other species we also show that the mechanism by which dnase ii cuts dna is similar to dnase i in that the enzyme produces nicks rather than double-strand cuts
B,almost all aphid species homoptera insecta have 60-80 huge cells called bacteriocytes within which are round-shaped bacteria that are designated buchnera these bacteria are maternally transmitted to eggs and embryos through host generations and the mutualism between the host and the bacteria is so obligate that neither can reproduce independently buchnera is a close relative of escherichia coli but it contains more than 100 genomic copies per cell and its genome size is only a seventh of that of e coli here we report the complete genome sequence of buchnera sp strain aps which is composed of one 640681-base-pair chromosome and two small plasmids there are genes for the biosyntheses of amino acids essential for the hosts in the genome but those for non-essential amino acids are missing indicating complementarity and syntrophy between the host and the symbiont in addition buchnera lacks genes for the biosynthesis of cell-surface components including lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids regulator genes and genes involved in defence of the cell these results indicate that buchnera is completely symbiotic and viable only in its limited niche the bacteriocyte
B,pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that is one of the top three causes of opportunistic human infections a major factor in its prominence as a pathogen is its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants here we report the complete sequence of p aeruginosa strain pao1 at 63 million base pairs this is the largest bacterial genome sequenced and the sequence provides insights into the basis of the versatility and intrinsic drug resistance of p aeruginosa consistent with its larger genome size and environmental adaptability p aeruginosa contains the highest proportion of regulatory genes observed for a bacterial genome and a large number of genes involved in the catabolism transport and efflux of organic compounds as well as four potential chemotaxis systems we propose that the size and complexity of the p aeruginosa genome reflect an evolutionary adaptation permitting it to thrive in diverse environments and resist the effects of a variety of antimicrobial substances
E,the sequence of the mitochondrial dna mtdna molecule of the blue whale balaenoptera musculus was determined the molecule is 16402 bp long and its organization conforms with that of other eutherian mammals the molecule was compared with the mtdna of the congeneric fin whale b physalus it was recently documented that the two species can hybridize and that male offspring are infertile whereas female offspring may be fertile the present comparison made it possible to determine the degree of mtdna difference that occurs between two species that are not completely separated by hybridization incompatibility the difference between the complete mtdna sequences was 74 lengths of peptide coding genes were the same in both species except for a small portion of the control region disruption in alignment was usually limited to insertiondeletion of a single nucleotide nucleotide differences between peptide coding genes ranged from 71 to 105 and difference at the inferred amino acid level was 00-79 in the rrna genes the mean transition difference was 38 this figure is similar in degree to the difference 34 between the 12s rrna gene of humans and the chimpanzee the mtdna differences between the two whale species involving both peptide coding and rrna genes suggest an evolutionary separation of  or  5 million years although hybridization between more distantly related mammalian species may not be excluded it is probable that the blue and fin whales are nearly as different in their mtdna sequences as hybridizing mammal species may be
B,thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis is a rod-shaped gram-negative anaerobic eubacterium that was isolated from a freshwater hot spring in tengchong china using a whole-genome-shotgun method we sequenced its 2689445-bp genome from an isolate mb4t genbank accession no ae008691 the genome encodes 2588 predicted coding sequences cds among them 1764 682 are classified according to homology to other documented proteins and the rest 824 cds 318 are functionally unknown one of the interesting features of the t tengcongensis genome is that 867 of its genes are encoded on the leading strand of dna replication based on protein sequence similarity the t tengcongensis genome is most similar to that of bacillus halodurans a mesophilic eubacterium among all fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes up to date computational analysis on genes involved in basic metabolic pathways supports the experimental discovery that t tengcongensis metabolizes sugars as principal energy and carbon source and utilizes thiosulfate and element sulfur but not sulfate as electron acceptors t tengcongensis as a gram-negative rod by empirical definitions such as staining shares many genes that are characteristics of gram-positive bacteria whereas it is missing molecular components unique to gram-negative bacteria a strong correlation between the g  c content of tdna and rdna genes and the optimal growth temperature is found among the sequenced thermophiles it is concluded that thermophiles are a biologically and phylogenetically divergent group of prokaryotes that have converged to sustain extreme environmental conditions over evolutionary timescale
B,helicobacter pylori is one of the most common human pathogens it causes chronic gastritis and is involved in the pathogenesis of gastroduodenal ulcer disease and possibly gastric carcinoma helicobacter mustelae is a bacterium closely related to h pylori that causes gastritis and ulcer disease in ferrets and is therefore considered an important animal model of gastric helicobacter infections motility even in a viscous environment is conferred to the bacteria by several sheathed flagella and is regarded as one of their principal virulence factors the flagellar filament of h pylori consists of two different flagellin species expressed in different amounts the gene flaa encoding the major flagellin has recently been cloned and sequenced here we report the cloning and sequencing of two highly homologous new flagellin genes from h pylori 85p and h mustelae nctc 12032 the nucleotide sequence of the h pylori gene proved that it encoded the second flagellin molecule found in h pylori flagellar filaments the genes were named flab the h mustelae and h pylori flab genes both coded for proteins with 514 amino acids and molecular masses of 540 and 539 kda respectively the proteins shared 817 identical amino acids the degree of conservation between h pylori flab and the h pylori flaa major flagellin was much lower 58 both flab genes were preceded by sigma 54-like promoter sequences mapping of the transcription start site for the h pylori flab gene by a primer extension experiment confirmed the functional activity of the sigma 54 promoter to evaluate the importance of both genes for motility flaa- and flab-disrupted mutants of h pylori n6 were constructed by electroporation-mediated allelic exchange and characterized by western blot immunoblot analysis and motility testing both mutations selectively abolished the expression of the targeted gene without affecting the synthesis of the other flagellin molecule whereas flaa mutants were completely nonmotile flab mutants retained motility
V,we present the 9312 nucleotide sequence of the prague c pr-c strain of rous sarcoma virus rsv a comparison of known protein sequences with the nucleotide sequence allows assignment of the coding regions for the gag pol env and src genes the gag gene is terminated by an amber stop codon and is contained within a different reading frame than is the pol gene the pol and env genes overlap the sequences surrounding the src gene in the pr-c and schmidt-ruppin sr-a strains of rsv have been compared and they reveal that an element e of approximately 153 nucleotides is present on the 3' side of the src gene in pr-c and on the 5' side in sr-a we hypothesize that e was part of a duplicated region of over 250 nucleotides flanking the src gene in an ancestral rsv and that differential deletion of one copy of e led to its positional difference in pr-c and sr-a
E,we have analysed a new gene cem1 from saccharomyces cerevisiae inactivation of this gene leads to a respiratory-deficient phenotype the deduced protein sequence shows strong similarities with beta-keto-acyl synthases or condensing enzymes typically enzymes of this class are involved in the synthesis of fatty acids or similar molecules an analysis of the mitochondrial lipids and fatty acids shows no major difference between the wild type and deleted strains implying that the cem1 gene product is not involved in the synthesis of the bulk fatty acids thus it is possible that the cem1 protein is involved in the synthesis of a specialized molecule probably related to a fatty acid which is essential for mitochondrial respiration
E,as part of our ongoing efforts to understand the functional role of vertebrate centractins we have identified a new member of the actin-related family of proteins in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae using a pcr-based approach consistent with the current nomenclature for actin-related proteins in yeast we propose to denote this locus act3 the primary amino acid sequence of act3p is most similar to canine and human alpha-centractin 73 similarity54 identity the sequence of a genomic clone indicates act3 lies adjacent to and is transcribed convergently with respect to fur1 on chromosome viii molecular genetic analysis indicates act3 is represented by a single gene from which the corresponding mrna is expressed at a low level compared to act1 tetrad analysis of heterozygotes harboring a trp1 replacement of the act3-coding region indicates act3 is nonessential for growth under normal conditions and at extremes of temperature and osmolarity however growth at 14 degrees c indicates a spindle orientation defect similar to phenotypes recently described for yeast harboring mutations in actin tubulin or cytoplasmic dynein taken together our data suggest that act3 is the s cerevisiae homologue of vertebrate centractins
B,the exbb and exbd genes of haemophilus influenzae hi were cloned and sequenced the deduced hi exbb and exbd proteins possessed 27 and 28 amino-acid identity 56 and 58 relatedness with the escherichia coli exbb and exbd proteins respectively two proteins which function as tonb accessory proteins during biopolymer transport plasmid-encoded hi exbb and exbd partially complemented an e coli exbbexbd mutation
B,a cosmid library from mycobacterium tuberculosis h37ra was introduced into mycobacterium smegmatis and eight recombinant clones with increased resistance to cefoxitin were identified isoelectric focusing detected an m tuberculosis-derived beta-lactamase in one of these recombinant clones a sequence analysis identified it as a class a beta-lactamase whose expression correlated with the increased resistance phenotype
B,we present the complete genome sequence of uropathogenic escherichia coli strain cft073 a three-way genome comparison of the cft073 enterohemorrhagic e coli edl933 and laboratory strain mg1655 reveals that amazingly only 392 of their combined nonredundant set of proteins actually are common to all three strains the pathogen genomes are as different from each other as each pathogen is from the benign strain the difference in disease potential between o157h7 and cft073 is reflected in the absence of genes for type iii secretion system or phage- and plasmid-encoded toxins found in some classes of diarrheagenic e coli the cft073 genome is particularly rich in genes that encode potential fimbrial adhesins autotransporters iron-sequestration systems and phase-switch recombinases striking differences exist between the large pathogenicity islands of cft073 and two other well-studied uropathogenic e coli strains j96 and 536 comparisons indicate that extraintestinal pathogenic e coli arose independently from multiple clonal lineages the different e coli pathotypes have maintained a remarkable synteny of common vertically evolved genes whereas many islands interrupting this common backbone have been acquired by different horizontal transfer events in each strain
B,the genus xanthomonas is a diverse and economically important group of bacterial phytopathogens belonging to the gamma-subdivision of the proteobacteria xanthomonas axonopodis pv citri xac causes citrus canker which affects most commercial citrus cultivars resulting in significant losses worldwide symptoms include canker lesions leading to abscission of fruit and leaves and general tree decline xanthomonas campestris pv campestris xcc causes black rot which affects crucifers such as brassica and arabidopsis symptoms include marginal leaf chlorosis and darkening of vascular tissue accompanied by extensive wilting and necrosis xanthomonas campestris pv campestris is grown commercially to produce the exopolysaccharide xanthan gum which is used as a viscosifying and stabilizing agent in many industries here we report and compare the complete genome sequences of xac and xcc their distinct disease phenotypes and host ranges belie a high degree of similarity at the genomic level more than 80 of genes are shared and gene order is conserved along most of their respective chromosomes we identified several groups of strain-specific genes and on the basis of these groups we propose mechanisms that may explain the differing host specificities and pathogenic processes
B,comparison of two fully sequenced genomes of buchnera aphidicola the obligate endosymbionts of aphids reveals the most extreme genome stability to date no chromosome rearrangements or gene acquisitions have occurred in the past 50 to 70 million years despite substantial sequence evolution and the inactivation and loss of individual genes in contrast the genomes of their closest free-living relatives escherichia coli and salmonella spp are more than 2000-fold more labile in content and gene order the genomic stasis of b aphidicola likely attributable to the loss of phages repeated sequences and reca indicates that b aphidicola is no longer a source of ecological innovation for its hosts
E,we have previously described the isolation of several genes expressed exclusively in the nervous system of adult xenopus laevis and activated in the embryo shortly after neural induction the sequence of one of these cdnas 24-15 identifies the corresponding protein as an isotype of the beta subunit of nak-atpase atp phosphohydrolase nak-transporting ec 36137 this form is distinct from the previously described beta 1 subunit of xenopus and the protein sequence comparison suggests that it is not the frog homolog of the mammalian beta 2 subunit therefore we refer to the 24-15 protein as the beta 3 subunit of nak-atpase of xenopus antisera directed against beta 3-subunit fusion protein detected a protein in adult brain extracts with the size and properties expected for a nak-atpase beta subunit in xenopus the beta 1 and beta 3 subunits are expressed as maternal mrnas at similar levels during embryogenesis rapid accumulation of beta 3 mrna begins at stage 14 early neurula and the rapid accumulation of beta 1 mrna begins at stage 2324 in situ hybridization of antisense rna probes to tadpole brain sections indicates that beta 3 subunit is expressed throughout the developing brain we suggest that beta 3 is a major nak-atpase beta subunit present during early nervous system development in the frog
B,the bacterium escherichia coli o157h7 is a worldwide threat to public health and has been implicated in many outbreaks of haemorrhagic colitis some of which included fatalities caused by haemolytic uraemic syndrome close to 75000 cases of o157h7 infection are now estimated to occur annually in the united states the severity of disease the lack of effective treatment and the potential for large-scale outbreaks from contaminated food supplies have propelled intensive research on the pathogenesis and detection of e coli o157h7 ref 4 here we have sequenced the genome of e coli o157h7 to identify candidate genes responsible for pathogenesis to develop better methods of strain detection and to advance our understanding of the evolution of e coli through comparison with the genome of the non-pathogenic laboratory strain e coli k-12 ref 5 we find that lateral gene transfer is far more extensive than previously anticipated in fact 1387 new genes encoded in strain-specific clusters of diverse sizes were found in o157h7 these include candidate virulence factors alternative metabolic capacities several prophages and other new functions--all of which could be targets for surveillance
E,we have isolated and characterized two diuretic hormones dh hylli-dh41 and hylli-dh30 from extracts of whole heads of the lepidopteran hyles lineata we monitored the isolation by measuring the ability of fractions to affect levels of cyclic amp production by malpighian tubules of manduca sexta maintained in vitro these dh are related to a family of vertebrate neuropeptides which includes sauvagine corticotropin-releasing factor crf and urotensin i both hylli-dh41 rmpslsidlpmsvlrqklsle kerkvqalraaanrnflndi-nh2 and hylli-dh30 sfsvnpaveilqhrymekvaqnnrnflnrv-nh2 show extremely high similarity with two dh from the tobacco hornworm m sexta this is not surprising because both h lineata and m sexta are sphingid moths the discovery of these dh provides a third example of two crf-related dh occurring in one insect species
B,we present here the complete genome sequence of a common avian clone of pasteurella multocida pm70 the genome of pm70 is a single circular chromosome 2257487 base pairs in length and contains 2014 predicted coding regions 6 ribosomal rna operons and 57 trnas genome-scale evolutionary analyses based on pairwise comparisons of 1197 orthologous sequences between p multocida haemophilus influenzae and escherichia coli suggest that p multocida and h influenzae diverged approximately 270 million years ago and the gamma subdivision of the proteobacteria radiated about 680 million years ago two previously undescribed open reading frames accounting for approximately 1 of the genome encode large proteins with homology to the virulence-associated filamentous hemagglutinin of bordetella pertussis consistent with the critical role of iron in the survival of many microbial pathogens in silico and whole-genome microarray analyses identified more than 50 pm70 genes with a potential role in iron acquisition and metabolism overall the complete genomic sequence and preliminary functional analyses provide a foundation for future research into the mechanisms of pathogenesis and host specificity of this important multispecies pathogen
E,we have isolated a 68 kda proteolipid from an acidic chloroformmethanol extract of bovine cardiac muscle the molecular mass of the polypeptide was measured by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry fab-ms mz68341 its amino acid sequence was partly determined by direct sequencing and completed by characterization of cyanogen bromide and tryptic fragments sequencing fab-ms and amino acid analysis the polypeptide consists of 60 amino acid residues polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbit allowed its localization by electroimmunoblotting in mitochondria
B,one of the chitinases of streptomyces lividans chitinase c was encoded by a 2 kb smai-xhoi restriction fragment contained in the recombinant plasmid pemj7 dna sequence analysis of this region revealed the presence of two open reading frames orf1 and orf2 which had opposite orientations northern analysis showed that only the mrna complementary to orf1 was transcribed and that this transcription was induced by chitin and repressed by glucose orf1 showed a codon distribution typical of streptomyces a sequence identical to that of the n-terminus of mature secreted chitinase c was found from amino acid residue 31 in the deduced amino acid sequence of orf1 619 amino acids implying that orf1 encodes a pre-protein of chitinase c the pre-protein of chitinase c consisted of four discrete domains the 30 amino acid n-terminal sequence domain 1 was characteristic of a signal peptide domain 2 consisted of 105 n-terminal amino acids of mature chitinase c and was similar to cellulose-binding domains of several cellulases domain 3 94 amino acids showed homology with type iii homology units of fibronectin domain 4 a c-terminal 390 amino acid sequence is probably the catalytic domain of the chitinase since it exhibited identity with several other chitinolytic enzymes
B,the citrulline biosynthetic operon argc-f located at 100 degrees on the bacillus subtilis chromosome contains seven open reading frames which encode all the enzymes required for the biosynthesis of citrulline the operon is transcribed as a single transcription unit the second cistron of the operon is homologous to argj ornithine acetyltransferase from bacillus stearothermophilus and neisseria gonorrhoeae suggesting that the acetylation of glutamate and the deacetylation of acetylornithine are carried out by a single enzyme in a cyclical pathway the argf gene is an orthologue of argf from pseudomonas aeruginosa and a paralogue of arcb from p aeruginosa and argfargi from escherichia coli
B,the levels of exoamylase and other exoenzymes of bacillus subtilis are pleiotropically decreased by the ecs-26 prs-26 and ecs-13 prs-13 mutations these mutations also cause a competence- and sporulation-deficient phenotype in the present work the ecs locus which has been defined by the ecs-26 and ecs-13 mutations was cloned and sequenced sequence analysis revealed a putative operon of three orfs ecsa ecsb and ecsc ecsa can encode a putative polypeptide of 248 amino acid residues containing an atp-binding site the polypeptide shows about 30 sequence similarity with the atp-binding components of numerous membrane transporters of the abc-type atp-binding cassette transporters or traffic atpases the ecs-26 mutation was found to result from a transition of one base pair chaning the glycine164 of ecsa to a glutamic acid residue in the vicinity of the putative atp-binding pocket ecsb was predicted to encode a hydrophobic protein with six membrane-spanning helices in a pattern found in other hydrophobic components of abc transporters the properties deduced for the ecsa and ecsb gene products are consistent with the interpretation that ecs encodes a novel abc-type membrane transporter of b subtilis the third orf ecsc can encode a putative polypeptide of 237 amino acid residues the polypeptide does not resemble components of abc transporters
E,full-length cdna clones encoding shikimate kinase ec 27171 an enzyme of the central section of the shikimate pathway have been isolated from tomato lycopersicon esculentum l cv uc82b the open reading frame has the capacity to encode a peptide of 300 amino acids the in-vitro synthesized peptide catalysed the phosphorylation of shikimate thus confirming the identity of the isolated cdna clones the n-terminal portion of the deduced amino acid sequence resembles known chloroplast-specific transit peptides the existence of such a transit peptide was proven by the uptake of the in-vitro synthesized peptide as well as its processing by isolated chloroplasts multiple sites of polyadenylation were observed in shikimate kinase mrnas the results of northern and southern blot analyses are consistent with the existence of only one shikimate kinase gene per haploid genome in tomato these results are discussed with respect to the dual pathway hypothesis of the shikimate pathway in higher plants
E,the complete nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences of homo sapiens cingulin cdna 5143 bp were determined by sequencing two distinct est clones that showed significant sequence homology to xenopus laevis cingulin protein sequence analysis indicates that the molecule contains two chains and has a tripartite structure with n-terminal head domains a coiled-coil rod domain length 120 nm and short c-terminal tail domains human and xenopus cingulin heads are only 33 identical yet a human cingulin n-terminal fragment still interacts with canine zo-1 and zo-2 in vitro the rod domain contains two a and two b subdomains though it lacks the third b subdomain present in xenopus cingulin the heptad substructures of xenopus and human cingulins were further characterized by computer analysis and indicated that the two-stranded coiled-coil structure contained chains that were parallel and in axial register fast fourier transform analysis and a scoring technique designed to recognize potential interactions between different supramolecular arrangements suggests that cingulin dimers may further assemble through antiparallel interactions between the last approximately 100 amino acids of the coiled-coil region cingulin mrna  approximately 52 kb was detected by northern blotting in epithelial tissues a human cingulin est was mapped to chromosome 1q21 using the unigene database
E,two marsupial casein genes have been isolated from a tammar wallaby macropus eugenii mammary gland cdna library comparisons of the tammar alpha- and beta-casein genes with their eutherian homologous reveal extensive divergence at the levels of nucleotide and amino acid sequences regions of similarity between the tammar and eutherian ca2-sensitive caseins are restricted to the major phosphorylation sites and the signal peptides quantification of casein mrna levels in hormone-stimulated mammary gland explants from tammars in late pregnancy suggests that maximal induction of the beta-casein gene is dependent upon prolactin and insulin while maximal induction of the alpha-casein gene is dependent upon prolactin insulin and cortisol these results are in contrast to earlier studies which show that the maximal induction of a putative 19 kda casein alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin in the tammar mammary gland is dependent upon prolactin alone the expression of the latter three genes is not modulated by other hormones known to play a role in the in-vitro initiation of lactation in eutherians
B,the 4 202 353 bp genome of the alkaliphilic bacterium bacillus halodurans c-125 contains 4066 predicted protein coding sequences cdss 2141 527 of which have functional assignments 1182 29 of which are conserved cdss with unknown function and 743 18 3 of which have no match to any protein database among the total cdss 88 match sequences of proteins found only in bacillus subtilis and 667 are widely conserved in comparison with the proteins of various organisms including bsubtilis the b halodurans genome contains 112 transposase genes indicating that transposases have played an important evolutionary role in horizontal gene transfer and also in internal genetic rearrangement in the genome strain c-125 lacks some of the necessary genes for competence such as coms srfa and rapc supporting the fact that competence has not been demonstrated experimentally in c-125 there is no paralog of tupa encoding teichuronopeptide which contributes to alkaliphily in the c-125 genome and an ortholog of tupa cannot be found in the bsubtilis genome out of 11 sigma factors which belong to the extracytoplasmic function family 10 are unique to b halodurans suggesting that they may have a role in the special mechanism of adaptation to an alkaline environment
B,the nucleotide sequence of a region of the azotobacter vinelandii genome exhibiting sequence similarity to nifh has been determined the order of open reading frames within this 61-kilobase-pair region was found to be anfh alternative nitrogen fixation nifh-like gene anfd nifd-like gene anfg potentially encoding a protein similar to the product of vnfg from azotobacter chroococcum anfk nifk-like gene followed by two additional open reading frames the 5'-flanking region of anfh contains a nif promoter similar to that found in the a vinelandii nifhdk gene cluster the presumed products of anfh anfd and anfk are similar in predicted mr and pi to the previously described subunits of nitrogenase 3 deletion plus insertion mutations introduced into the anfhdgk region of wild-type strain a vinelandii ca resulted in mutant strains that were unable to grow in mo-deficient n-free medium but grew in the presence of 1 microm na2moo4 or v2o5 introduction of the same mutations into the nifhdk deletion strain ca11 resulted in strains that grew under diazotrophic conditions only in the presence of vanadium the lack of nitrogenase 3 subunits in these mutant strains was demonstrated through two-dimensional gel analysis of protein extracts from cells derepressed for nitrogenase under mo and v deficiency these results indicate that anfh anfd and anfk encode structural proteins for nitrogenase 3
B,two novel type i catechol 12-dioxygenases inducible on aniline media were isolated from acinetobacter lwoffii k24 although the two purified enzymes cd i1 and cd i2 had similar intradiol cleavage activities they showed different substrate specificities for catechol analogs physicochemical properties and amino acid sequences two cata genes cata1 and cata2 encoding by cd i1 and cd i2 respectively were isolated from the a lwoffii k24 genomic library by using colony hybridization and pcr two dna fragments containing the cata1 and cata2 genes were located on separate regions of the chromosome they contained open reading frames encoding 334- and 304-kda proteins the amino acid sequences of the two proteins matched well with previously determined sequences interestingly further analysis of the two dna fragments revealed the locations of the catb and catc genes as well moreover the dna fragment containing cata1 had a cluster of genes in the order catb1-catc1-cata1 while the catb2-cata2-catc2 arrangement was found in the cata2 dna fragment these results may provide an explanation of the different substrate specificities and physicochemical properties of cd i1 and cd i2
B,increased protection against a virulent challenge with mycobacterium tuberculosis is induced mainly by a previous immunization with living avirulent mycobacteria usually mycobacterium bovis bcg only a transient and marginal protection is obtained after immunization with bacterial extracts or dead bacteria both living and heat-killed bacteria share a number of common antigens in order to identify mycobacterial molecules which are dominant antigens during immunization with living bacteria a two-step selection method was used two groups of guinea pigs were immunized either with living or with heat-killed bcg sera were then collected and used to select and counterselect antigens present in bcg culture filtrates each major fraction eluted from a series of high-pressure liquid chromatography columns gel filtration deae and reverse-phase chromatography was run on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred on polyvinylidene difluoride sheets the molecules present on twin immunoblots were stained with antibodies raised in guinea pigs immunized either with living or with heat-killed bcg cross-reactive antigens stained in twin immunoblots were eliminated major antigens interacting with antibodies raised after immunization only with living bacteria were further purified a complex of 45- and 47-kda major molecules 4547-kda complex was thus identified and further purified the complex was found to interact only with antibodies present in sera of guinea pigs immunized with living bacteria and not at all with antibodies raised after immunization with dead bacteria the 4547-kda antigen complex molecules were resolved on two-dimensional electrophoresis in three major and seven minor proteins detected with silver staining all the molecules interacted with the antibodies present in sera of guinea pigs immunized with living bcg the three major proteins two at 47 kda and one at 45 kda were amino-terminal sequenced the sequence a-p-e-p-a-p-p-v-p-p-a-a-a-a-p-p-a which was not previously reported was the same for these three molecules by using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay the concentrations of the 4547-kda antigen complex were measured in bcg culture filtrates freeze-dried bcg and dried heat-killed bcg they were respectively 2 001 and 0001 of the total mass the low or very low values compared with the high antibody concentration emphasized the ability of the 4547-kda complex delivered through live bcg to trigger an antibody response
E,we report the molecular cloning and sequence of the cdna coding for the biotin-containing subunit of the chloroplastic acetylcoenzyme a coa carboxylase accase of arabidopsis thaliana cac1 the 3' end of the cac1 sequence coding for a peptide of 94 amino acids which includes a putative biotinylation motif was expressed in escherichia coli as a glutathione-s-transferase gst fusion protein the resulting gst-cac1 fusion protein was biotinylated in vivo indicating that cac1 codes for a biotin-containing protein antibodies generated to the gst-cac1 protein reacted solely with the 38-kd biotin-containing polypeptide of arabidopsis furthermore these antibodies inhibited accase activity in extracts from arabidopsis leaves the deduced amino acid sequence of cac1 has an apparent n-terminal chloroplast-targeting transit peptide the cac1 protein is coded by a single arabidopsis gene and its mrna accumulates to the highest levels in organs that are undergoing rapid growth the amino acid sequence of the cac1 protein is most similar to the biotin carboxyl-carrier protein component of eubacterial accases these characterizations identify cac1 as the biotin-containing subunit of the plastidic heteromeric accase of arabidopsis the results support the ancient origin of the two structurally distinct accases of plants
B,the entire genome of a thermophilic unicellular cyanobacterium thermosynechococcus elongatus bp-1 was sequenced the genome consisted of a circular chromosome 2593857 bp long and no plasmid was detected a total of 2475 potential protein-encoding genes one set of rrna genes 42 trna genes representing 42 trna species and 4 genes for small structural rnas were assigned to the chromosome by similarity search and computer prediction the translated products of 56 of the potential protein-encoding genes showed sequence similarity to experimentally identified and predicted proteins of known function and the products of 34 of these genes showed sequence similarity to the translated products of hypothetical genes the remaining 10 lacked significant similarity to genes for predicted proteins in the public dna databases sixty-three percent of the t elongatus genes showed significant sequence similarity to those of both synechocystis sp pcc 6803 and anabaena sp pcc 7120 while 22 of the genes were unique to this species indicating a high degree of divergence of the gene information among cyanobacterial strains the lack of genes for typical fatty acid desaturases and the presence of more genes for heat-shock proteins in comparison with other mesophilic cyanobacteria may be genomic features of thermophilic strains a remarkable feature of the genome is the presence of 28 copies of group ii introns 8 of which contained a presumptive gene for maturasereverse transcriptase a trace of genome rearrangement mediated by the group ii introns was also observed
E,the amino acid sequence of the mammary derived growth inhibitor mdgi from bovine mammary gland bhmer f-d kraft r otto a  wernstedt c hellman u kurtz a mller t rohde k etzold g lehmann w langen p heldin c-h and grosse r 1987 j biol chem 262 15137-15143 revealed 95 identity to bovine heart fatty acid-binding protein h-fabp explaining the observed immunocross-reactivity however a cdna encoding mdgi has not been found to date artificial mdgi cdna was expressed in an in vitro transcriptiontranslation assay analysis by isoelectric focusing of the immunoprecipitated in vitro translation products of lactating bovine mammary gland mrna did not indicate a protein corresponding to the in vitro translation product of artificial mdgi mrna moreover two-dimensional electrophoresis of bovine mammary gland proteins confirmed the absence of a protein with the pi of the in vitro translated artificial mdgi mrna in bovine mammary gland and instead revealed apart from h-fabp an unknown protein that was recognized by anti-h-fabp antibodies from lactating bovine mammary gland the cdna for adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein a-fabp was cloned the in vitro translation of recombinant mrna derived from this cdna yielded a polypeptide that behaved like the unknown immunoreactive protein western blotting and immunofluorescence using monospecific antibodies demonstrated the coexistence of h-fabp and a-fabp in the lactating mammary gland taking into account that deviations of the mdgi sequence from the bovine h-fabp sequence correspond with a-fabp we attribute the structure originally reported as mdgi to a mix of these proteins
B,the 3-a structure of dna-binding protein ii which exhibits histone-like properties in bacteria has been determined the molecule is dimeric and appears to bind to the phosphate backbone of dna through two symmetry-related arms a mechanism by which the protein induces dna supercoiling is proposed
B,plasmid-free strains of enterococcus faecalis secrete a peptide sex pheromone cad1 which specifically induces a mating response by donors carrying the hemolysin plasmid pad1 or related elements a determinant on the e faecalis og1x chromosome has been found to encode a 465-kda protein that plays an important role in the production of the extracellular cad1 wild-type e faecalis og1x cells harboring a plasmid chimera carrying the determinant exhibited an eightfold enhanced production of cad1 and plasmid-free cells carrying a mutated chromosomal determinant secreted undetectable or very low amounts of the pheromone the production of other pheromones such as cpd1 cob1 and ccf10 was also influenced although there was no effect on the pheromone cam373 the determinant designated eep for enhanced expression of pheromone did not include the sequence of the pheromone its deduced product eep contains apparent membrane-spanning sequences conceivably it is involved in processing a pheromone precursor structure or in some way regulates expression or secretion
E,the rat aldolase c gene was isolated from a rat genomic dna library this gene comprises 9 exons and spans 3590 base pairs a single copy of the gene occurs per haploid rat genome the initiation of transcription occurs at two different sites the cellular localization of aldolase c mrna was determined in the central nervous system along with aldolase a mrna by in situ hybridization the result indicates the predominant expression of this gene in purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex where aldolase a mrna was rather repressed
E,although the sister-group relationship between cetacea and artiodactyla is widely accepted the actual artiodactyl group which is closest to cetacea has not been conclusively identified in the present study we have sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome of the hippopotamus hippopotamus amphibius and included it in phylogenetic analyses together with 15 other placental mammals these analyses separated the hippopotamus from the other suiform included the pig and identified the hippopotamus as the artiodactyl sister group of the cetaceans thereby making both artiodactyla and the suborder suiformes paraphyletic the divergence between the hippopotamid and cetacean lineages was calculated using this molecular data and was estimated at ca 54 ma bp
E,the nucleotide sequence of the penicillium chrysogenum oli13 acva gene encoding delta-l-alpha-aminoadipyl-l-cysteinyl-d-valine synthetase which performs the first step in penicillin biosynthesis has been determined the acva gene contains an open reading frame of 11238 bp encoding a protein of 3746 amino acids with a predicted mol wt of 421073 dalton three domains within the protein of approximately 570 amino acids have between 38 and 43 identity with each other and share similarity with two antibiotic peptide synthetases from bacillus brevis as well as two other enzymes capable of performing atp-pyrophosphate exchange reactions the acva gene is located close to the pcbc gene encoding isopenicillin n synthetase the enzyme for the second step of beta-lactam biosynthesis and is transcribed in the opposite orientation to it the intergenic region of 1107 bp from which the acva and pcbc genes are divergently transcribed has also been sequenced
E,f-box proteins are an expanding family of eukaryotic proteins characterized by an approximately 40 aminoacid motif the f box so named because cyclin f was one of the first proteins in which this motif was identified 1 some f-box proteins have been shown to be critical for the controlled degradation of cellular regulatory proteins 2 3 in fact f-box proteins are one of the four subunits of ubiquitin protein ligases called scfs the other three subunits are the skp1 protein one of the cullin proteins cul1 in metazoans and cdc53 or cul a in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and the recently identified roc1 protein also called rbx1 or hrt1 scf ligases bring ubiquitin conjugating enzymes either ubc3 or ubc4 to substrates that are specifically recruited by the different f-box proteins the need for high substrate specificity and the large number of known f-box proteins in yeast and worms 2 4 suggest the existence of a large family of mammalian f-box proteins using skp1 as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen and by searching dna databases we identified a family of 26 human f-box proteins 25 of which were novel some of these proteins contained wd-40 domains or leucine-rich repeats others contained either different protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs we have named the f-box proteins that contain wd-40 domains fbws those containing leucine-rich repeats fbls and the remaining ones fbxs we have further characterized representative members of these three classes of f-box proteins
E,the complete mitochondrial dna mtdna molecule of the ostrich struthio camelus was sequenced the size of the molecule is 16591 nucleotides since the ostrich represents the paleognathous birds comparison with the mtdna of the neognathous chicken the only avian species reported so far in databases made it possible to identify common and probably general avian mtdna characteristics relative to other vertebrates the avian nadh6 and trna-glu genes are positioned upstream of the control region rather than the cytochrome b gene the nadh3 gene of the ostrich is terminated by a stop codon at position 207 thus the gene is about 140 nucleotides shorter than in other vertebrates the sequence for l-strand origin of replication is missing in both birds and four transfer rna genes of the two avian mtdnas deviate from common characteristics of trnas of vertebrate mtdnas by having an adenine and not a thymidine at position 8 due to the absence of suitable fossils most paleontological datings of avian divergences are conjectural molecular dating of the divergence between the ostrich and the chicken indicates that these two avian lineages separated 80-90 mya phylogenetic analysis of complete cytochrome b genes of six avian orders showed that passeriformes represent the earliest divergence among recent birds contradicting the commonly accepted notion of a basal position of the palaeognathae among recent birds
E,members of the suppressor of cytokine signalling socs family of proteins have been shown to inhibit cytokine signalling via direct interactions with jak kinases or activated cytokine receptors in addition to their novel amino-terminal regions and sh2 domains that mediate these interactions the socs proteins also contain carboxy-terminal regions of homology called the socs box the socs box serves to couple socs proteins and their binding partners with the elongin b and c complex possibly targeting them for degradation several other families of proteins also contain socs boxes but differ from the socs proteins in the type of domain or motif they contain upstream of the socs box we report here the cloning characterization mapping and expression analysis of four members of the ankyrin repeat and socs box-containing asb protein family
E,in order to investigate the mechanisms governing the striated muscle-specific expression of cytochrome c oxidase viah we have characterized the murine gene and analyzed its transcriptional regulatory elements in skeletal myogenic cell lines the gene is single copy spans 689 base pairs bp and is comprised of three exons the 5'-ends of transcripts from the gene are heterogeneous but the most abundant transcript includes a 5'-untranslated region of 30 nucleotides when fused to the luciferase reporter gene the 35-kilobase 5'-flanking region of the gene directed the expression of the heterologous protein selectively in differentiated sol8 cells and transgenic mice recapitulating the pattern of expression of the endogenous gene deletion analysis identified a 300-bp fragment sufficient to direct the myotube-specific expression of luciferase in sol8 cells the region lacks an apparent tata element and sequence motifs predicted to bind nrf-1 nrf-2 ox-box or ppar factors known to regulate other nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins are not evident mutational analysis however identified two cis-elements necessary for the high level expression of the reporter protein a mef2 consensus element at -90 to -81 bp and an e-box element at -147 to -142 bp additional e-box motifs at closely located positions were mutated without loss of transcriptional activity the dependence of transcriptional activation of cytochrome c oxidase viah on cis-elements similar to those found in contractile protein genes suggests that the striated muscle-specific expression is coregulated by mechanisms that control the lineage-specific expression of several contractile and cytosolic proteins
B,staphylococcus epidermidis strains are diverse in their pathogenicity some are invasive and cause serious nosocomial infections whereas others are non-pathogenic commensal organisms to analyse the implications of different virulence factors in staphylococcus epidermidis infections the complete genome of staphylococcus epidermidis strain atcc 12228 a non-biofilm forming non-infection associated strain used for detection of residual antibiotics in food products was sequenced this strain showed low virulence by mouse and rat experimental infections the genome consists of a single 2499 279 bp chromosome and six plasmids the chromosomal g  c content is 321 and 2419 protein coding sequences cds are predicted among which 230 are putative novel genes compared to the virulence factors in staphylococcus aureus aside from delta-haemolysin and beta-haemolysin other toxin genes were not found in contrast the majority of adhesin genes are intact in atcc 12228 most strikingly the ica operon coding for the enzymes synthesizing interbacterial cellular polysaccharide is missing in atcc 12228 and rearrangements of adjacent genes are shown no mec genes is256 is257 were found in atcc 12228 it is suggested that the absence of the ica operon is a genetic marker in commensal staphylococcus epidermidis strains which are less likely to become invasive
B,almost all aphid species homoptera insecta have 60-80 huge cells called bacteriocytes within which are round-shaped bacteria that are designated buchnera these bacteria are maternally transmitted to eggs and embryos through host generations and the mutualism between the host and the bacteria is so obligate that neither can reproduce independently buchnera is a close relative of escherichia coli but it contains more than 100 genomic copies per cell and its genome size is only a seventh of that of e coli here we report the complete genome sequence of buchnera sp strain aps which is composed of one 640681-base-pair chromosome and two small plasmids there are genes for the biosyntheses of amino acids essential for the hosts in the genome but those for non-essential amino acids are missing indicating complementarity and syntrophy between the host and the symbiont in addition buchnera lacks genes for the biosynthesis of cell-surface components including lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids regulator genes and genes involved in defence of the cell these results indicate that buchnera is completely symbiotic and viable only in its limited niche the bacteriocyte
A,the complete 166-megabase pair genome sequence of an autotrophic archaeon methanococcus jannaschii and its 58- and 16-kilobase pair extrachromosomal elements have been determined by whole-genome random sequencing a total of 1738 predicted protein-coding genes were identified however only a minority of these 38 percent could be assigned a putative cellular role with high confidence although the majority of genes related to energy production cell division and metabolism in m jannaschii are most similar to those found in bacteria most of the genes involved in transcription translation and replication in m jannaschii are more similar to those found in eukaryotes
E,analysis of the mitochondrial dna of a liverwort marchantia polymorpha by electron microscopy and restriction endonuclease mapping indicated that the liverwort mitochondrial genome was a single circular molecule of about 184400 base-pairs we have determined the complete sequence of the liverwort mitochondrial dna and detected 94 possible genes in the sequence of 186608 base-pairs these included genes for three species of ribosomal rna 29 genes for 27 species of transfer rna and 30 open reading frames orfs for functionally known proteins 16 ribosomal proteins 3 subunits of h-atpase 3 subunits of cytochrome c oxidase apocytochrome b protein and 7 subunits of nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase three orfs showed similarity to orfs of unknown function in the mitochondrial genomes of other organisms furthermore 29 orfs were predicted as possible genes by using the index of g  c content in first second and third letters of codons 420 - 109 370 - 132 and 264 - 94 respectively obtained from the codon usages of identified liverwort genes to date 32 introns belonging to either group i or group ii intron have been found in the coding regions of 17 genes including ribosomal rna genes rrn18 and rrn26 a transfer rna gene trns and a pseudogene psi nad7 rna editing was apparently lacking in liverwort mitochondria since the nucleotide sequences of the liverwort mitochondrial dna were well-conserved at the dna level
B,dominant mutations of the cet gene of escherichia coli result in tolerance to colicin e2 and increased amounts of an inner membrane protein with an mr of 42000 we have cloned the cet gene and sequenced its dna revealing that the gene product coded by the longest open-reading frame has an mr of 49772 with five predicted transmembrane structures towards its carboxy terminus and one at ist amino terminus we have demonstrated that the cet locus does in fact code for the inner membrane protein that is present in increased amounts in cet mutants and we have shown that this increased amount of cet protein is the result of enhanced transcription the cet gene is shown to be in the same operon as the phom gene which is required in a phor background for expression of the structural gene for alkaline phosphatase phoa although the cet protein is not required for phoa expression our experiments suggest that the cet protein has an enhancing effect on the transcription of phoa no effect of phosphate concentration on cet or phom gene expression could be found and thus their primary function may not be connected to the phosphate regulon
E,recent studies revealed a striking difference in the genomic organization of classic cadherin genes and one family of nonclassic cadherin genes designated protocadherins specifically the dna sequences encoding the ectodomain repeats of classic cadherins are interrupted by multiple introns by contrast all of the encoded ectodomains of each member of the protocadherin gene clusters are present in one large exon to determine whether large ectodomain exons are a general feature of protocadherin genes we have investigated the genomic organization of several additional human protocadherin genes by using dna sequence information in genbank these genes include protocadherin 12 pcdh12 an ortholog of the mouse vascular endothelial cadherin-2 gene hfmi1 and hfmi2 homologs of the drosophila planar cell polarity gene flamingo hfat2 a homolog of the drosophila tumor suppressor gene fat and the drosophila dn-cadherin and de-cadherin genes each of these genes was found to be a member of the protocadherin subfamily based on amino acid sequence comparisons of their ectodomains remarkably all of these protocadherin genes share a common feature most of the genomic dna sequences encoding their ectodomains are not interrupted by an intron we conclude that the presence of unusually large exons is a characteristic feature of protocadherin genes
A,the complete genomic sequence of an aerobic thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon sulfolobus tokodaii strain7 which optimally grows at 80 degrees c at low ph and under aerobic conditions has been determined by the whole genome shotgun method with slight modifications the genomic size was 2694756 bp long and the g  c content was 328 the following rna-coding genes were identified a single 16s-23s rrna cluster one 5s rrna gene and 46 trna genes including 24 intron-containing trna genes the repetitive sequences identified were sr-type repetitive sequences long dispersed-type repetitive sequences and tn-like repetitive elements the genome contained 2826 potential protein-coding regions open reading frames orfs by similarity search against public databases 911 322 orfs were related to functional assigned genes 921 326 were related to conserved orfs of unknown function 145 51 contained some motifs and remaining 849 300 did not show any significant similarity to the registered sequences the orfs with functional assignments included the candidate genes involved in sulfide metabolism the tca cycle and the respiratory chain sequence comparison provided evidence suggesting the integration of plasmid rearrangement of genomic structure and duplication of genomic regions that may be responsible for the larger genomic size of the s tokodaii strain7 genome the genome contained eukaryote-type genes which were not identified in other archaea and lacked the cca sequence in the trna genes the result suggests that this strain is closer to eukaryotes among the archaea strains so far sequenced the data presented in this paper are also available on the internet homepage httpwwwbionitegojpe-homegenomelist-ehtml
E,a solution to higher level mammalian phylogeny is going to depend on the congruent establishment of superordinal groupings followed by a linking together of these clades we present congruent and convincing evidence from four disparate nuclear protein coding genes and from a tandem alignment of the 12s-16s mitochondrial region for a superordinal clade of endemic african mammals that includes elephant shrews aardvarks golden mole elephants sirenians and hyraxes because of strong support for golden mole as part of this clade the insectivora are rendered paraphyletic or polyphyletic with constrained monophyly of the insectivores judged significantly worse in the vast majority of tests branching arrangement within this clade remains highly uncertain however a tandem alignment of the protein coding genes suggests elephant shrew is the earliest african lineage none of the individual data sets or combinations of data sets support the widely held view of a mirorder tethytheria sireniaproboscidea although only a tandem alignment of protein coding and mitochondrial loci significantly rejects this association the majority of the data sets and analyses provide strong support for caviomorpha as part of a monophyletic rodentia
B,the 1860725-base-pair genome of thermotoga maritima msb8 contains 1877 predicted coding regions 1014 54 of which have functional assignments and 863 46 of which are of unknown function genome analysis reveals numerous pathways involved in degradation of sugars and plant polysaccharides and 108 genes that have orthologues only in the genomes of other thermophilic eubacteria and archaea of the eubacteria sequenced to date t maritima has the highest percentage 24 of genes that are most similar to archaeal genes eighty-one archaeal-like genes are clustered in 15 regions of the t maritima genome that range in size from 4 to 20 kilobases conservation of gene order between t maritima and archaea in many of the clustered regions suggests that lateral gene transfer may have occurred between thermophilic eubacteria and archaea
B,the genome sequences of chlamydia trachomatis mouse pneumonitis mopn strain nigg 1 069 412 nt and chlamydia pneumoniae strain ar39 1 229 853 nt were determined using a random shotgun strategy the mopn genome exhibited a general conservation of gene order and content with the previously sequenced ctrachomatis serovar d differences between ctrachomatis strains were focused on an approximately 50 kb 'plasticity zone' near the termination origins in this region mopn contained three copies of a novel gene encoding a 3000 amino acid toxin homologous to a predicted toxin from escherichia coli o157h7 but had apparently lost the tryptophan biosyntheis genes found in serovar d in this region the c pneumoniae ar39 chromosome was 999 identical to the previously sequenced cpneumoniae cwl029 genome however comparative analysis identified an invertible dna segment upstream of the uridine kinase gene which was in different orientations in the two genomes ar39 also contained a novel 4524 nt circular single-stranded ssdna bacteriophage the first time a virus has been reported infecting c pneumoniae although the chlamydial genomes were highly conserved there were intriguing differences in key nucleotide salvage pathways cpneumoniae has a uridine kinase gene for dutp production mopn has a uracil phosphororibosyl transferase while ctrachomatis serovar d contains neither gene chromosomal comparison revealed that there had been multiple large inversion events since the species divergence of ctrachomatis and cpneumoniae apparently oriented around the axis of the origin of replication and the termination region the striking synteny of the chlamydia genomes and prevalence of tandemly duplicated genes are evidence of minimal chromosome rearrangement and foreign gene uptake presumably owing to the ecological isolation of the obligate intracellular parasites in the absence of genetic analysis comparative genomics will continue to provide insight into the virulence mechanisms of these important human pathogens
B,staphylococcus epidermidis strains are diverse in their pathogenicity some are invasive and cause serious nosocomial infections whereas others are non-pathogenic commensal organisms to analyse the implications of different virulence factors in staphylococcus epidermidis infections the complete genome of staphylococcus epidermidis strain atcc 12228 a non-biofilm forming non-infection associated strain used for detection of residual antibiotics in food products was sequenced this strain showed low virulence by mouse and rat experimental infections the genome consists of a single 2499 279 bp chromosome and six plasmids the chromosomal g  c content is 321 and 2419 protein coding sequences cds are predicted among which 230 are putative novel genes compared to the virulence factors in staphylococcus aureus aside from delta-haemolysin and beta-haemolysin other toxin genes were not found in contrast the majority of adhesin genes are intact in atcc 12228 most strikingly the ica operon coding for the enzymes synthesizing interbacterial cellular polysaccharide is missing in atcc 12228 and rearrangements of adjacent genes are shown no mec genes is256 is257 were found in atcc 12228 it is suggested that the absence of the ica operon is a genetic marker in commensal staphylococcus epidermidis strains which are less likely to become invasive
B,mycobacterium bovis is the causative agent of tuberculosis in a range of animal species and man with worldwide annual losses to agriculture of 3 billion the human burden of tuberculosis caused by the bovine tubercle bacillus is still largely unknown m bovis was also the progenitor for the m bovis bacillus calmette-gurin vaccine strain the most widely used human vaccine here we describe the 4345492-bp genome sequence of m bovis af212297 and its comparison with the genomes of mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium leprae strikingly the genome sequence of m bovis is 9995 identical to that of m tuberculosis but deletion of genetic information has led to a reduced genome size comparison with m leprae reveals a number of common gene losses suggesting the removal of functional redundancy cell wall components and secreted proteins show the greatest variation indicating their potential role in host-bacillus interactions or immune evasion furthermore there are no genes unique to m bovis implying that differential gene expression may be the key to the host tropisms of human and bovine bacilli the genome sequence therefore offers major insight on the evolution host preference and pathobiology of m bovis
B,the genome sequences of chlamydia trachomatis mouse pneumonitis mopn strain nigg 1 069 412 nt and chlamydia pneumoniae strain ar39 1 229 853 nt were determined using a random shotgun strategy the mopn genome exhibited a general conservation of gene order and content with the previously sequenced ctrachomatis serovar d differences between ctrachomatis strains were focused on an approximately 50 kb 'plasticity zone' near the termination origins in this region mopn contained three copies of a novel gene encoding a 3000 amino acid toxin homologous to a predicted toxin from escherichia coli o157h7 but had apparently lost the tryptophan biosyntheis genes found in serovar d in this region the c pneumoniae ar39 chromosome was 999 identical to the previously sequenced cpneumoniae cwl029 genome however comparative analysis identified an invertible dna segment upstream of the uridine kinase gene which was in different orientations in the two genomes ar39 also contained a novel 4524 nt circular single-stranded ssdna bacteriophage the first time a virus has been reported infecting c pneumoniae although the chlamydial genomes were highly conserved there were intriguing differences in key nucleotide salvage pathways cpneumoniae has a uridine kinase gene for dutp production mopn has a uracil phosphororibosyl transferase while ctrachomatis serovar d contains neither gene chromosomal comparison revealed that there had been multiple large inversion events since the species divergence of ctrachomatis and cpneumoniae apparently oriented around the axis of the origin of replication and the termination region the striking synteny of the chlamydia genomes and prevalence of tandemly duplicated genes are evidence of minimal chromosome rearrangement and foreign gene uptake presumably owing to the ecological isolation of the obligate intracellular parasites in the absence of genetic analysis comparative genomics will continue to provide insight into the virulence mechanisms of these important human pathogens
B,staphylococcus epidermidis strains are diverse in their pathogenicity some are invasive and cause serious nosocomial infections whereas others are non-pathogenic commensal organisms to analyse the implications of different virulence factors in staphylococcus epidermidis infections the complete genome of staphylococcus epidermidis strain atcc 12228 a non-biofilm forming non-infection associated strain used for detection of residual antibiotics in food products was sequenced this strain showed low virulence by mouse and rat experimental infections the genome consists of a single 2499 279 bp chromosome and six plasmids the chromosomal g  c content is 321 and 2419 protein coding sequences cds are predicted among which 230 are putative novel genes compared to the virulence factors in staphylococcus aureus aside from delta-haemolysin and beta-haemolysin other toxin genes were not found in contrast the majority of adhesin genes are intact in atcc 12228 most strikingly the ica operon coding for the enzymes synthesizing interbacterial cellular polysaccharide is missing in atcc 12228 and rearrangements of adjacent genes are shown no mec genes is256 is257 were found in atcc 12228 it is suggested that the absence of the ica operon is a genetic marker in commensal staphylococcus epidermidis strains which are less likely to become invasive
B,a multipurpose broad host range plasmid pij3200 was constructed by inserting the polylinker-containing 445 bp pvuii fragment of bluescript m13 into the ecori site of the cosmid plafr1 using this vector a protease gene of xanthomonas campestris pathovar campestris previously cloned in the recombinant plasmid pij3070 was located by deletion to a 22 kb dna region sequencing of the protease gene revealed an open reading frame encoding a 580 amino acid polypeptide with molecular weight of 57000 the deduced amino acid sequence showed strong homology with the subtilisin family of serine proteases this together with its sensitivity to inhibition by phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride suggests that the enzyme belongs to this family of proteases
E,udpgalactose n-acetyl-d-glucosamine 4-beta-d-galactosyltransferase ec 24138 galt is a golgi-membrane-bound enzyme that participates in the biosynthesis of the oligosaccharide structures of glycoproteins and glycolipids synthetic dna oligomers representing segments of the published partial cdna sequence for bovine galt were used as molecular probes to isolate from bovine-liver cdna libraries overlapping cdna clones that span 1728 nucleotides and potentially code for the entire polypeptide chain of bovine galactosyltransferase the cdna sequence for bovine galt reveals a 1206-base-pair open reading frame that codes for 402 amino acids including a presumptive n-terminal membrane anchoring domain of 20 hydrophobic amino acids the colinearity between the cdna sequence and 29 non-overlapping amino acid residues which were positively identified by n-terminal sequencing of two polypeptides isolated from the soluble form of the enzyme was consistent with the translation frame and confirmed the authenticity of the cdna clones the finding of an n-terminal hydrophobic segment which serves as the membrane anchor and signal sequence suggests that the c-terminal region of the galt polypeptide is oriented within the lumen of the golgi membranes this conclusion is in agreement with previous biochemical studies which indicated that the 51-kda and 42-kda soluble forms of the enzyme which encompass the c-terminal 324 and 297 amino acid residues of the entire galt polypeptide respectively include the catalytic site
E,cdc2 and several related genes encode the catalytic subunits of cyclin-dependent kinases which have been implicated in a number of cellular processes including control of cell division as a first step in exploring their function in plants we isolated four cdc2-related genes from antirrhinum two genes cdc2a and cdc2b encode proteins that contain a perfectly conserved pstaire motif characteristic of cdc2 homologs whereas the products of the two remaining genes cdc2c and cdc2d appear to represent a new subclass of proteins that have so far only been identified in plants transcripts of these novel genes were localized in isolated cells dispersed throughout actively dividing regions of the inflorescence this localization is consistent with accumulation that is specific to particular phases of the cell cycle correlating cell labeling with nuclear condensation and double-labeling experiments using cdc2 and histone h4 as probes indicated that cdc2c transcripts accumulate during s phase as well as during the g2 and m transition whereas cdc2d expression was specific to the g2 and m phases all cells labeled with cdc2d also contained cdc2c label indicating that expression of cdc2d completely overlapped with that of cdc2c transcripts of cdc2a and cdc2b were detected in all cells within actively dividing regions but at levels that were only slightly higher than those observed in nondividing areas these transcripts did not appear to accumulate in a cell cycle-specific fashion the genes cdc2a and cdc2b were able to partially complement a yeast cdc2 mutation although all four genes appeared to interfere with the sizing mechanism of yeast cells we propose that plants contain at least two classes of cdc2-related genes that differ in structure expression and perhaps function
B,almost all aphid species homoptera insecta have 60-80 huge cells called bacteriocytes within which are round-shaped bacteria that are designated buchnera these bacteria are maternally transmitted to eggs and embryos through host generations and the mutualism between the host and the bacteria is so obligate that neither can reproduce independently buchnera is a close relative of escherichia coli but it contains more than 100 genomic copies per cell and its genome size is only a seventh of that of e coli here we report the complete genome sequence of buchnera sp strain aps which is composed of one 640681-base-pair chromosome and two small plasmids there are genes for the biosyntheses of amino acids essential for the hosts in the genome but those for non-essential amino acids are missing indicating complementarity and syntrophy between the host and the symbiont in addition buchnera lacks genes for the biosynthesis of cell-surface components including lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids regulator genes and genes involved in defence of the cell these results indicate that buchnera is completely symbiotic and viable only in its limited niche the bacteriocyte
B,the gram-negative bacterium yersinia pestis is the causative agent of the systemic invasive infectious disease classically referred to as plague and has been responsible for three human pandemics the justinian plague sixth to eighth centuries the black death fourteenth to nineteenth centuries and modern plague nineteenth century to the present day the recent identification of strains resistant to multiple drugs and the potential use of y pestis as an agent of biological warfare mean that plague still poses a threat to human health here we report the complete genome sequence of y pestis strain co92 consisting of a 465-megabase mb chromosome and three plasmids of 962 kilobases kb 703 kb and 96 kb the genome is unusually rich in insertion sequences and displays anomalies in gc base-composition bias indicating frequent intragenomic recombination many genes seem to have been acquired from other bacteria and viruses including adhesins secretion systems and insecticidal toxins the genome contains around 150 pseudogenes many of which are remnants of a redundant enteropathogenic lifestyle the evidence of ongoing genome fluidity expansion and decay suggests y pestis is a pathogen that has undergone large-scale genetic flux and provides a unique insight into the ways in which new and highly virulent pathogens evolve
B,bacillus anthracis is an endospore-forming bacterium that causes inhalational anthrax key virulence genes are found on plasmids extra-chromosomal circular double-stranded dna molecules pxo1 ref 2 and pxo2 ref 3 to identify additional genes that might contribute to virulence we analysed the complete sequence of the chromosome of b anthracis ames about 523 megabases we found several chromosomally encoded proteins that may contribute to pathogenicity--including haemolysins phospholipases and iron acquisition functions--and identified numerous surface proteins that might be important targets for vaccines and drugs almost all these putative chromosomal virulence and surface proteins have homologues in bacillus cereus highlighting the similarity of b anthracis to near-neighbours that are not associated with anthrax by performing a comparative genome hybridization of 19 b cereus and bacillus thuringiensis strains against a b anthracis dna microarray we confirmed the general similarity of chromosomal genes among this group of close relatives however we found that the gene sequences of pxo1 and pxo2 were more variable between strains suggesting plasmid mobility in the group the complete sequence of b anthracis is a step towards a better understanding of anthrax pathogenesis
E,hepatitis c virus hcv glycoprotein e2 binds to human cells by interacting with the cd81 molecule which has been proposed to be the viral receptor a correlation between binding to cd81 and species permissiveness to hcv infection has also been reported we have determined the sequence of cd81 from the tamarin a primate species known to be refractory to hcv infection tamarin cd81 t-cd81 differs from the human molecule at 5 amino acid positions 155 163 169 180 and 196 within the large extracellular loop lel where the binding site for e2 has been located soluble recombinant forms of human cd81 h-cd81 t-cd81 and african green monkey cd81 agm-cd81 lel molecules were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for binding to e2 glycoprotein both h-cd81 and t-cd81 molecules were able to bind e2 competition experiments showed that the two receptors cross-compete and that the t-cd81 binds with stronger affinity than the human molecule recently h-cd81 residue 186 has been characterized as the critical residue involved in the interaction with e2 recombinant cd81 mutant proteins were expressed to test whether human and tamarin receptors interacted with e2 in a comparable manner mutation of residue 186 f186l dramatically reduced the binding capability of t-cd81 a result that has already been demonstrated for the human receptor whereas the opposite mutation l186f in agm-cd81 resulted in a neat gain of binding activity finally the in vitro data were confirmed by detection of e2 binding to cotton-top tamarin saguinus oedipus cell line b95-8 expressing endogenous cd81 these results indicate that the binding of e2 to cd81 is not predictive of an infection-producing interaction between hcv and host cells
B,salmonella enterica serovar typhi s typhi is the aetiological agent of typhoid fever a serious invasive bacterial disease of humans with an annual global burden of approximately 16 million cases leading to 600000 fatalities many s enterica serovars actively invade the mucosal surface of the intestine but are normally contained in healthy individuals by the local immune defence mechanisms however s typhi has evolved the ability to spread to the deeper tissues of humans including liver spleen and bone marrow here we have sequenced the 4809037-base pair bp genome of a s typhi ct18 that is resistant to multiple drugs revealing the presence of hundreds of insertions and deletions compared with the escherichia coli genome ranging in size from single genes to large islands notably the genome sequence identifies over two hundred pseudogenes several corresponding to genes that are known to contribute to virulence in salmonella typhimurium this genetic degradation may contribute to the human-restricted host range for s typhi ct18 harbours a 218150-bp multiple-drug-resistance inch1 plasmid phcm1 and a 106516-bp cryptic plasmid phcm2 which shows recent common ancestry with a virulence plasmid of yersinia pestis
E,rabbit 25 kda fk-506rapamycin binding protein fkbp25 cdna was isolated during a screening of rabbit corneal endothelial cdna library the cdna clone was a 955 bp fragment with a 670 bp open reading frame and a 285 bp 3' non-coding region the cdna and deduced amino acid sequences were 917 and 964 identical respectively to previously reported human fkbp25b sequences the lysine-rich region kkx7kkx26kkkk which plays an important role in nuclear translocation in rabbit fkbp25 was recognized reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr amplification of rabbit fkbp25 and fkbp12 in selected rabbit organs including total cornea showed higher expressions in cornea retina cerebrum and cerebellum than other compared tissues rt-pcr amplification in rabbit cultured corneal cells showed expressions in all cultured corneal epithelial stromal endothelial and especially in sv40-adenovirus vector-immortalized epithelial cells the higher expressions of fkbp25 and fkbp12 suggest significant roles for fkbps in those tissues
E,a cdna library corresponding to mite protein was screened using anti-der f ii a major allergen from the house dust mite dermatophagoides farinae antibody three possible clones were obtained that contained cdna fragments coding for der f ii and the nucleotide sequences of the fragments were determined there were minor differences observed affecting the deduced amino acid sequence among the three cdna fragments the amino acid sequence of the purified native der f ii protein could be analyzed to 45 residues from the n-terminus as a result of comparison all the three cdna fragments code for a mature protein with a derived molecular weight of about 14000 the amino acid sequence was not homologous to any known protein sequences and it contained six cysteine residues and no n-glycosylation sites
B,access to mineral nitrogen often limits plant growth and so symbiotic relationships have evolved between plants and a variety of nitrogen-fixing organisms these associations are responsible for reducing 120 million tonnes of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia each year in agriculture independence from nitrogenous fertilizers expands crop production and minimizes pollution of water tables lakes and rivers here we present the complete nucleotide sequence and gene complement of the plasmid from rhizobium sp ngr234 that endows the bacterium with the ability to associate symbiotically with leguminous plants in conjunction with transcriptional analyses these data demonstrate the presence of new symbiotic loci and signalling mechanisms the sequence and organization of genes involved in replication and conjugal transfer are similar to those of agrobacterium suggesting a recent lateral transfer of genetic information
E,the riken mouse gene encyclopaedia project a systematic approach to determining the full coding potential of the mouse genome involves collection and sequencing of full-length complementary dnas and physical mapping of the corresponding genes to the mouse genome we organized an international functional annotation meeting fantom to annotate the first 21076 cdnas to be analysed in this project here we describe the first riken clone collection which is one of the largest described for any organism analysis of these cdnas extends known gene families and identifies new ones
B,two genes aac encoding aminoglycoside-n-acetyltransferase from streptomyces fradiae and micromonospora chalcea were cloned the former identified by hybridization with a homologous gene from streptomyces rimosus forma paromomycinus the second by direct expression in streptomyces lividans using pij702 as a vector these two genes showed pronounced nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities between themselves and also between previously described streptomycetes aac genes comparison of the flanking sequence of actinomycetes aac genes indicates considerable divergence contrary to the notion that clustered biosynthetic genes for structurally related antibiotics were disseminated in their entirety between microbial species
B,streptomyces coelicolor is a representative of the group of soil-dwelling filamentous bacteria responsible for producing most natural antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicine here we report the 8667507 base pair linear chromosome of this organism containing the largest number of genes so far discovered in a bacterium the 7825 predicted genes include more than 20 clusters coding for known or predicted secondary metabolites the genome contains an unprecedented proportion of regulatory genes predominantly those likely to be involved in responses to external stimuli and stresses and many duplicated gene sets that may represent 'tissue-specific' isoforms operating in different phases of colonial development a unique situation for a bacterium an ancient synteny was revealed between the central 'core' of the chromosome and the whole chromosome of pathogens mycobacterium tuberculosis and corynebacterium diphtheriae the genome sequence will greatly increase our understanding of microbial life in the soil as well as aiding the generation of new drug candidates by genetic engineering
E,this paper reports the dna sequence of a segment of 98 kb of the chromosome iii the sequenced dna contains the mat alpha locus the new sequence of the mat alpha locus differs from the previously reported sequence by six modifications in the w segment we have found the same modifications in the hml locus the corrected sequence contains in hml an open reading frame orf of 190 codons which ends at the border between the w segment and the flanking dna in the mat locus this orf extends in the flanking dna up to 538 codons this orf corresponds to a gene independently identified as bud5 chant et al 1991 this gene presents homologies with the exchange factors sdc25 and cdc25 a large orf of 1399 codons is found on the opposite side of mat alpha toward the telomere this orf corresponds to a new gene ycr724 next to this gene is a small orf ycr725 of 127 codons the localization of this fragment on chromosome iii originally supposed to be distal from the mat locus based on genetic distance illustrates variation in recombination frequency along the chromosome and suggests the existence of hot spots of recombination between mat and the thr4 locus
E,the anaphase-promoting complex is composed of eight protein subunits including bime apc1 cdc27 apc3 cdc16 apc6 and cdc23 apc8 the remaining four human apc subunits apc2 apc4 apc5 and apc7 as well as human cdc23 were cloned apc7 contains multiple copies of the tetratrico peptide repeat similar to cdc16 cdc23 and cdc27 whereas apc4 and apc5 share no similarity to proteins of known function apc2 contains a region that is similar to a sequence in cullins a family of proteins implicated in the ubiquitination of g1 phase cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors the apc2 gene is essential in saccharomyces cerevisiae and apc2 mutants arrest at metaphase and are defective in the degradation of pds1p apc2 and cullins may be distantly related members of a ubiquitin ligase family that targets cell cycle regulators for degradation
A,the sequence of a 281-kbp contig from the crenarchaeote sulfolobus solfataricus p2 was determined and analysed notable features in this region include 29 ribosomal protein genes 12 trna genes four of which contain archaeal-type introns operons encoding enzymes of histidine biosynthesis pyrimidine biosynthesis and arginine biosynthesis an atpase operon numerous genes for enzymes of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and six insertion sequences the content and organization of this contig are compared with sequences from crenarchaeotes euryarchaeotes bacteria and eukaryotes
B,shewanella oneidensis is an important model organism for bioremediation studies because of its diverse respiratory capabilities conferred in part by multicomponent branched electron transport systems here we report the sequencing of the s oneidensis genome which consists of a 4969803-base pair circular chromosome with 4758 predicted protein-encoding open reading frames cds and a 161613-base pair plasmid with 173 cdss we identified the first shewanella lambda-like phage providing a potential tool for further genome engineering genome analysis revealed 39 c-type cytochromes including 32 previously unidentified in s oneidensis and a novel periplasmic fe hydrogenase which are integral members of the electron transport system this genome sequence represents a critical step in the elucidation of the pathways for reduction and bioremediation of pollutants such as uranium u and chromium cr and offers a starting point for defining this organism's complex electron transport systems and metal ion-reducing capabilities
E,myotonic dystrophy dm is an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disease that is associated with a ctgn repeat expansion in the 3'-untranslated region of the myotonin protein kinase mt-pk gene this study reports the isolation and characterization of a cugn triplet repeat pre-mrnamrna binding protein that may play an important role in dm pathogenesis two hela cell proteins cug-bp1 and cug-bp2 have been purified based upon their ability to bind specifically to cug8 oligonucleotides in vitro while cug-bp1 is the major cug8-binding activity in normal cells nuclear cug-bp2 binding activity increases in dm cells both cug-bp1 and cug-bp2 have been identified as isoforms of a novel heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein hnrnp hnab50 the cug-bphnab50 protein is localized predominantly in the nucleus and is associated with polyadenylated rnas in vivo in vitro rna-bindingphotocrosslinking studies demonstrate that cug-bphnab50 binds to rnas containing the mt-pk 3'-utr we propose that the cugn repeat region in mt-pk mrna is a binding site for cug-bphnab50 in vivo and triplet repeat expansion leads to sequestration of this hnrnp on mutant mt-pk transcripts
B,we report the complete genome sequence of the model bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato dc3000 dc3000 which is pathogenic on tomato and arabidopsis thaliana the dc3000 genome 65 megabases contains a circular chromosome and two plasmids which collectively encode 5763 orfs we identified 298 established and putative virulence genes including several clusters of genes encoding 31 confirmed and 19 predicted type iii secretion system effector proteins many of the virulence genes were members of paralogous families and also were proximal to mobile elements which collectively comprise 7 of the dc3000 genome the bacterium possesses a large repertoire of transporters for the acquisition of nutrients particularly sugars as well as genes implicated in attachment to plant surfaces over 12 of the genes are dedicated to regulation which may reflect the need for rapid adaptation to the diverse environments encountered during epiphytic growth and pathogenesis comparative analyses confirmed a high degree of similarity with two sequenced pseudomonads pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas aeruginosa yet revealed 1159 genes unique to dc3000 of which 811 lack a known function
B,the genus xanthomonas is a diverse and economically important group of bacterial phytopathogens belonging to the gamma-subdivision of the proteobacteria xanthomonas axonopodis pv citri xac causes citrus canker which affects most commercial citrus cultivars resulting in significant losses worldwide symptoms include canker lesions leading to abscission of fruit and leaves and general tree decline xanthomonas campestris pv campestris xcc causes black rot which affects crucifers such as brassica and arabidopsis symptoms include marginal leaf chlorosis and darkening of vascular tissue accompanied by extensive wilting and necrosis xanthomonas campestris pv campestris is grown commercially to produce the exopolysaccharide xanthan gum which is used as a viscosifying and stabilizing agent in many industries here we report and compare the complete genome sequences of xac and xcc their distinct disease phenotypes and host ranges belie a high degree of similarity at the genomic level more than 80 of genes are shared and gene order is conserved along most of their respective chromosomes we identified several groups of strain-specific genes and on the basis of these groups we propose mechanisms that may explain the differing host specificities and pathogenic processes
E,the identification of all human chromosome 21 hc21 genes is a necessary step in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of trisomy 21 down syndrome the first analysis of the sequence of 21q included 127 previously characterized genes and predicted an additional 98 novel anonymous genes recently we evaluated the quality of this annotation by characterizing a set of hc21 open reading frames c21orfs identified by mapping spliced expressed sequence tags ests and predicted genes preds identified only in silico this study underscored the limitations of in silico-only gene prediction as many preds were incorrectly predicted to refine the hc21 annotation we have developed a reliable algorithm to extract and stringently map sequences that contain bona fide 3' transcript ends to the genome we then created a specific 21q graphical display allowing an integrated view of the data that incorporates new ests as well as features such as cpg islands repeats and gene predictions using these tools we identified 27 new putative genes to validate these we sequenced previously cloned cdnas and carried out rt-pcr 5'- and 3'-race procedures and comparative mapping these approaches substantiated 19 new transcripts thus increasing the hc21 gene count by 95 these transcripts were likely not previously identified because they are small and encode small proteins we also identified four transcriptional units that are spliced but contain no obvious open reading frame the hc21 data presented here further emphasize that current gene prediction algorithms miss a substantial number of transcripts that nevertheless can be identified using a combination of experimental approaches and multiple refined algorithms
E,a cdna encoding rabbit cardiac calsequestrin was isolated and characterized the deduced nascent cardiac calsequestrin contains 409 amino acids of which 26 are acidic residues and had 93 and 67 aa identity with canine cardiac calsequestrin and rabbit fast-twitch skeletal muscle calsequestrin respectively rna blot analyses indicate that this mrna is expressed in atrium ventricle and to a lesser amount in slow-twitch skeletal muscle this mrna transcript is not expressed in adult fast-twitch skeletal muscle smooth muscle or nonmuscle tissues analysis of in vitro skeletal muscle myogenesis using a mouse myoblast cell line c2c12 demonstrates that both cardiac and skeletal calsequestrin isoforms are coproduced during muscle differentiation
E,the fly drosophila melanogaster is one of the most intensively studied organisms in biology and serves as a model system for the investigation of many developmental and cellular processes common to higher eukaryotes including humans we have determined the nucleotide sequence of nearly all of the approximately 120-megabase euchromatic portion of the drosophila genome using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy supported by extensive clone-based sequence and a high-quality bacterial artificial chromosome physical map efforts are under way to close the remaining gaps however the sequence is of sufficient accuracy and contiguity to be declared substantially complete and to support an initial analysis of genome structure and preliminary gene annotation and interpretation the genome encodes approximately 13600 genes somewhat fewer than the smaller caenorhabditis elegans genome but with comparable functional diversity
E,the primary neuroendocrine interface hypothalamus and pituitary together with adrenals constitute the major axis responsible for the maintenance of homeostasis and the response to the perturbations in the environment the gene expression profiling in the human hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis was catalogued by generating a large amount of expressed sequence tags ests followed by bioinformatics analysis httpwwwchgcshcn database totally 25973 sequences of good quality were obtained from 31130 clones 834 from cdna libraries of the hypothalamus pituitary and adrenal glands after eliminating 5347 sequences corresponding to repetitive elements and mtdna 20626 ests could be assembled into 9 175 clusters 3979 3074 and 4116 clusters in hypothalamus pituitary and adrenal glands respectively when overlapping ests were integrated of these clusters 2777 303 corresponded to known genes 4165 448 to dbests and 2233 243 to novel ests the gene expression profiles reflected well the functional characteristics of the three levels in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis because most of the 20 genes with highest expression showed statistical difference in terms of tissue distribution including a group of tissue-specific functional markers meanwhile some findings were made with regard to the physiology of the axis and 200 full-length cdnas of novel genes were cloned and sequenced all of these data may contribute to the understanding of the neuroendocrine regulation of human life
B,salmonella enterica serovar typhi s typhi is the aetiological agent of typhoid fever a serious invasive bacterial disease of humans with an annual global burden of approximately 16 million cases leading to 600000 fatalities many s enterica serovars actively invade the mucosal surface of the intestine but are normally contained in healthy individuals by the local immune defence mechanisms however s typhi has evolved the ability to spread to the deeper tissues of humans including liver spleen and bone marrow here we have sequenced the 4809037-base pair bp genome of a s typhi ct18 that is resistant to multiple drugs revealing the presence of hundreds of insertions and deletions compared with the escherichia coli genome ranging in size from single genes to large islands notably the genome sequence identifies over two hundred pseudogenes several corresponding to genes that are known to contribute to virulence in salmonella typhimurium this genetic degradation may contribute to the human-restricted host range for s typhi ct18 harbours a 218150-bp multiple-drug-resistance inch1 plasmid phcm1 and a 106516-bp cryptic plasmid phcm2 which shows recent common ancestry with a virulence plasmid of yersinia pestis
E,flaveria spp accumulate flavonol sulfate esters whose biosynthesis is catalyzed by a number of position-specific flavonol sulfotransferases although the accumulation of sulfated flavonols appears to be tissue specific and developmentally regulated and to vary among related species little is known about the mechanism of regulation controlling the synthesis of these metabolites in the present work we report the isolation of a cdna clone from flaveria bidentis pbfst3 encoding flavonol 3-sulfotransferase f3-st which catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of flavonol polysulfates this clone pbfst3 was expressed in escherichia coli and produced an f3-st with high affinity for the flavonol aglycones quercetin and its 7-methyl derivative rhamnetin in addition the synthetic auxin 24-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid was shown to induce f3-st enzyme activity and f3-st mrna transcript levels in cell cultures of f bidentis the f3-st mrna levels increased within the first 3 h reaching a maximum after 24 h of treatment and remained elevated for up to 48 h treatments with either quercetin 3-sulfate or quercetin 374'-trisulfate reduced f3-st enzyme activity in cell cultures but had no effect on the transcript levels these results are discussed in relation to the putative role of flavonoid conjugates in the regulation of auxin transport
E,we have constructed cdna clones containing the complete nucleotide sequences coding for two highly antigenic schistosoma mansoni adult worm proteins sm31 and sm32 the predicted amino acid sequence of sm31 shows significant homology to mouse rat and human cathepsin b the nucleotide sequence of sm32 is identical to that reported by others for s mansoni haemoglobinase' the different nucleotide sequences demonstrate the existence of two different proteolytic enzymes both of which are synthesised in the form of precursor molecules structural homology of the schistosome cathepsin b to the mammalian ones indicates that the mature protein is processed from a propeptide the calculated molecular weight of haemoglobinase of 47000 suggests that post-translational processing is also involved in generating an active protease
B,the halophile vibrio vulnificus is an etiologic agent of human mortality from seafood-borne infections we applied whole-genome sequencing and comparative analysis to investigate the evolution of this pathogen the genome of biotype 1 strain v vulnificus yj016 was sequenced and includes two chromosomes of estimated 3377 kbp and 1857 kbp in size and a plasmid of 48508 bp a super-integron si was identified and the si region spans 139 kbp and contains 188 gene cassettes in contrast to non-si sequences the captured gene cassettes are unique for any given vibrio species and are highly variable among v vulnificus strains multiple rearrangements were found when comparing the 53-mbp v vulnificus yj016 genome and the 40-mbp v cholerae el tor n16961 genome the organization of gene clusters of capsular polysaccharide iron metabolism and rtx toxin showed distinct genetic features of v vulnificus and v cholerae the content of the v vulnificus genome contained gene duplications and evidence of horizontal transfer allowing for genetic diversity and function in the marine environment the genomic information obtained in this study can be applied to monitoring vibrio infections and identifying virulence genes in v vulnificus
B,the complete genome sequence of the radiation-resistant bacterium deinococcus radiodurans r1 is composed of two chromosomes 2648638 and 412348 base pairs a megaplasmid 177466 base pairs and a small plasmid 45704 base pairs yielding a total genome of 3284 156 base pairs multiple components distributed on the chromosomes and megaplasmid that contribute to the ability of d radiodurans to survive under conditions of starvation oxidative stress and high amounts of dna damage were identified deinococcus radiodurans represents an organism in which all systems for dna repair dna damage export desiccation and starvation recovery and genetic redundancy are present in one cell
E,we have isolated a cdna from a human placental choriocarcinoma cell cdna library which when expressed in hela cells induces a na-dependent amino acid transport system with preference for zwitterionic amino acids anionic amino acids cationic amino acids imino acids and n-methylated amino acids are excluded by this system these characteristics are identical to those described for the amino acid transporter bo when expressed in xenopus laevis oocytes that do not have detectable endogenous activity of the amino acid transporter bo the cloned transporter increases alanine transport in the oocytes severalfold and induces alanine-evoked inward currents in the presence of na the cdna codes for a polypeptide containing 541 amino acids with 10 putative transmembrane domains amino acid sequence homology predicts this transporter hatbo to be a member of a superfamily consisting of the glutamate transporters the neutral amino acid transport system asct and the insulin-activable neutralanionic amino acid transporter chromosomal assignment studies with somatic cell hybrid analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridization have located the atbo gene to human chromosome 19q133
E,to investigate the relationships among the three main groups of extant neopterygian fishes--amiidae lepisosteidae and teleostei--we sequenced fragments of three mitochondrial genes from 12 different actinopterygian fishes and translated the nucleotide sequences into amino acid sequences when all three regions are considered together amiidae clusters with lepisosteidae in the most parsimonious cladograms but other clades such as neopterygii and teleostei that are well supported by morphological evidence fail to emerge as monophyletic when the cytochrome b sequences are analyzed together with previously published sequences for other taxa the majority-rule consensus tree is consistent with the monophyly of teleostei and neopterygii and marginally supports the amiidae  lepisosteidae clade in either analysis when neopterygii and teleostei are constrained to monophyly all the most-parsimonious cladograms support the amiidae  lepisosteidae topology where molecules and morphology disagree provisional morphology-based constraints on the analysis of molecular data offer a practical means of integrating the two types of data
B,listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen with a high mortality rate that has also emerged as a paradigm for intracellular parasitism we present and compare the genome sequences of l monocytogenes 2944528 base pairs and a nonpathogenic species l innocua 3011209 base pairs we found a large number of predicted genes encoding surface and secreted proteins transporters and transcriptional regulators consistent with the ability of both species to adapt to diverse environments the presence of 270 l monocytogenes and 149 l innocua strain-specific genes clustered in 100 and 63 islets respectively suggests that virulence in listeria results from multiple gene acquisition and deletion events
E,a gene designated s has been identified in the class i region of the human major histocompatibility complex the s gene is located 160 kb telomeric of hla-c it is expressed at high levels as 22-kb and 26-kb mrnas in human skin no homologous transcripts were detected in other tissues including placenta liver spleen thymus and brain in situ hybridization showed that s gene expression was restricted to the differentiating keratinocytes in the granular layer of the epidermis the predicted amino acid sequence of the s protein was remarkable for its high content of serine glycine and proline there were significant similarities with the amino acid sequences of loricrin keratin 1 and keratin 10 all major components of the granular-cell layer the selective expression of the s gene in the granular-cell layer in the epidermis suggests a role in the developmental program of differentiating keratinocytes furthermore in light of the recognized association of psoriasis vulgaris a disorder of keratinocyte proliferation with alleles of hla-c this gene may contribute primarily to the pathogenesis of this common disorder
B,motility of the alkalophilic bacillus sp c-125 a flagellate bacterium was demonstrated to be na- and ph-dependent flagellin protein from this strain was purified to homogeneity and the n-terminal sequence determined using the hag gene of bacillus subtilis as a probe the hag gene of bacillus sp c-125 was identified and cloned into escherichia coli sequencing of this hag gene revealed that it encodes a protein of 272 amino acids mr 29995 the predicted n terminal sequence of this protein was identical to that determined by n-terminal sequencing of the flagellin protein from strain c-125 the alkalophilic bacillus sp c-125 flagellin shares homology with other known flagellins in both the n- and c-terminal regions the middle portion however shows considerable differences even from that of flagellin from the related species b subtilis
E,chitin synthase activity was studied in yeast and hyphal forms of candida albicans ph-activity profiles showed that yeast and hyphae contain a protease-dependent activity that has an optimum at ph 68 in addition there is an activity that is not activated by proteolysis in vitro and which shows a peak at ph 80 this suggests there are two distinct chitin synthases in c albicans a gene for chitin synthase from c albicans chs1 was cloned by heterologous expression in a saccharomyces cerevisiae chs1 mutant proof that the cloned chitin synthase is a c albicans membrane-bound zymogen capable of chitin biosynthesis in vitro was based on several criteria i the chs1 gene complemented the s cerevisiae chs1 mutation and encoded enzymatic activity which was stimulated by partial proteolysis ii the enzyme catalyses incorporation of 14c-glcnac from the substrate udpu-14c-glcnac into alkali-insoluble chitin iii southern analysis showed hybridization of a c albicans chs1 probe only with c albicans dna and not with s cerevisiae dna iv ph profiles of the cloned enzyme showed an optimum at ph 68 this overlaps with the ph-activity profiles for chitin synthase measured in yeast and hyphal forms of c albicans thus chs1 encodes only part of the chitin synthase activity in c albicans a gene for a second chitin synthase in c albicans with a ph optimum at 80 is proposed dna sequencing revealed an open reading frame of 2328 nucleotides which predicts a polypeptide of mr 88281 with 776 amino acids the alignment of derived amino acid sequences revealed that the chs1 gene from c albicans canchs1 is homologous 37 amino acid identity to the chs1 gene from s cerevisiae sacchs1
E,alpha 2-macroglobulin alpha 2 m was isolated from plasma of the freshwater crayfish pacifastacus leniusculus using ultracentrifugation ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration techniques the pacifastacus alpha 2 m molecule p alpha 2 m was radio-actively labeled in the thiol ester structure with iodo 14cacetic acid in the presence of methylamine after reduction and carboxymethylation of the protein it was digested with trypsin a 14c-labeled tryptic peptide was sequenced and contained an amino acid sequence very similar to other known thiol ester sequences from human alpha 2 m and related proteins the n-terminal sequence of p alpha 2 m was related to that recently determined for lobster alpha 2 m 1987 j biol chem 262 14606-14611
E,the antigen receptor on human t lymphocytes consists of two variable immunoglobulin-like glycoproteins alpha and beta which occur in association with three invariable t3 membrane proteins in humans two of these proteins t3-gamma and t3-delta are glycoproteins of relative molecular mass mr 25000 25k and 20000 20k respectively while the third t3-epsilon is a 20k non-glycosylated protein on the surface of murine t cells a non-glycosylated protein dimer composed of 17k subunits t3-zeta is found associated with the t-cell receptor alpha and beta chains and the three t3-like polypeptide chains it is generally accepted that major histocompatibility complex-restricted antigen recognition is a function of the alpha-beta heterodimer this has led to the postulation that the proteins of the t3 complex are involved in the signal transduction that immediately follows antigen recognition via the antigen receptor events believed to be involved in early t-cell activation such as rapid increases in phosphatidylinositol turnover and free intracellular calcium can be triggered by antibodies directed against either the t3 complex or the clonotypic receptor we have previously reported our findings on the cloning of the complementary dna and genomic structure encoding both the human and murine 20k glycoprotein t3-delta refs 11-13 we now present our results on the cloning of the cdna encoding the human 20k non-glycosylated chain t3-epsilon
E,1 chinchilla chinchilla villidera alpha-1-antitrypsin has been purified to homogeneity and partially characterized according to mol wt amino acid and carbohydrate composition and n-terminal amino acid sequence 30 residues 2 the mol wt is between 52000 and 55000 as determined by page or sedimentation equilibrium 3 the best alignment between chinchilla human and baboon alpha-1-antitrypsin amino acid sequences offsets the chinchilla sequence 6 positions vs the primate structures 4 this alignment suggests potential importance of the sequence his-glu-gln-glu-his at positions 11-15 5 additionally the segment leu-ala-glu-phe-ala positions 25-29 is strictly conserved 6 shorter n-terminal sequences available for rat and rabbit alpha-1-antitrypsin appear to follow the offset alignment vs the primate structures
B,the low-mr penicillin-binding protein pbpdd-transpeptidase of streptomyces k15 is synthesized in the form of a 291-amino acid-residue precursor possessing a cleavable 29-amino acid-residue signal peptide sequence-similarity searches and hydrophobic-cluster analysis show that the streptomyces k15 enzyme the escherichia coli pbpsdd-carboxy-peptidases 5 and 6 the bacillus subtilis pbpdd-carboxypeptidase 5 and the spoiia product a putative pbp involved in the sporulation of b subtilis are structurally related and form a distinct class a of low-mr pbpsdd-peptidases the distribution of the hydrophobic clusters along the amino acid sequences also shows that the streptomyces k15 pbp and by extension the other pbps of class a have similarity in the polypeptide folding with the beta-lactamases of class a with as reference the streptomyces albus g and staphylococcus aureus beta-lactamases of known three-dimensional structure this comparison allows one to predict most of the secondary structures in the pbps and the amino acid motifs that define the enzyme active sites
E,we have analyzed the temporal and spatial expression of genes encoding the glycoxylate cycle enzymes isocitrate lyase and malate synthase in brassica napus l to determine whether they are coordinately expressed both enzymes participate in reactions associated with lipid mobilization in oilseed plant seedlings and are sequestered in a specialized organelle the glyoxysome we have identified an isocitrate lyase cdna clone containing the complete protein coding region rna blot and in situ hybridization studies with isocitrate lyase and malate synthase cdna clones from b napus showed that the genes exhibit similar expression patterns the mrnas begin to accumulate during late embryogeny reach maximal levels in seedling cotyledons are not detected at significant amounts in leaves and are distributed similarly in cotyledons and axes of seedlings furthermore transcription studies with isolated nuclei indicate that the genes are controlled primarily although not exclusively at the transcriptional level we conclude that glyoxysome biogenesis is regulated in part through the coordinate expression of isocitrate lyase and malate synthase genes
E,we have sequenced and annotated the genome of fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe which contains the smallest number of protein-coding genes yet recorded for a eukaryote 4824 the centromeres are between 35 and 110 kilobases kb and contain related repeats including a highly conserved 18-kb element regions upstream of genes are longer than in budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae possibly reflecting more-extended control regions some 43 of the genes contain introns of which there are 4730 fifty genes have significant similarity with human disease genes half of these are cancer related we identify highly conserved genes important for eukaryotic cell organization including those required for the cytoskeleton compartmentation cell-cycle control proteolysis protein phosphorylation and rna splicing these genes may have originated with the appearance of eukaryotic life few similarly conserved genes that are important for multicellular organization were identified suggesting that the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes required more new genes than did the transition from unicellular to multicellular organization
B,the 4 202 353 bp genome of the alkaliphilic bacterium bacillus halodurans c-125 contains 4066 predicted protein coding sequences cdss 2141 527 of which have functional assignments 1182 29 of which are conserved cdss with unknown function and 743 18 3 of which have no match to any protein database among the total cdss 88 match sequences of proteins found only in bacillus subtilis and 667 are widely conserved in comparison with the proteins of various organisms including bsubtilis the b halodurans genome contains 112 transposase genes indicating that transposases have played an important evolutionary role in horizontal gene transfer and also in internal genetic rearrangement in the genome strain c-125 lacks some of the necessary genes for competence such as coms srfa and rapc supporting the fact that competence has not been demonstrated experimentally in c-125 there is no paralog of tupa encoding teichuronopeptide which contributes to alkaliphily in the c-125 genome and an ortholog of tupa cannot be found in the bsubtilis genome out of 11 sigma factors which belong to the extracytoplasmic function family 10 are unique to b halodurans suggesting that they may have a role in the special mechanism of adaptation to an alkaline environment
E,fmrfamide-like immunoreactivity fli was localized in the eyestalk of penaeus monodon by immunohistochemistry using a combination of three anti-fmrfamide-like peptide flps monoclonal antibodies approximately 3000 small neuronal cell bodies in the lamina ganglionalis 100 medium to large size at the ganglion between the medulla interna and the medulla terminalis and 250 medium size around the medulla terminalis were stained intensely the neuronal processes in neuropils of the medulla externa medulla interna medulla terminalis sinus gland and some nerve fibers in the optic nerve were also recognized the small cell bodies approximately 1500 cells anterior to the medulla externa were stained inconsistently and the neuronal processes were not observed from these cells isolation of flps from 9000 eyestalks was performed using methanolaceticwater 9019 extraction after the extract was partially purified using c18 cartridges it was further purified by five to seven steps of rp-hplc using three kinds of columns c18 c8 and cyano and three solvent systems acetonitriletrifluoro acetic acid aceonitrileheptafluoro butyric acid and acetonitriletriethyl ammonium acetate dot-elisa using the combination of the same antibodies was used to monitor flps in the fractions during purification processes seven new sequences of flps were identified which can be divided into four subgroups according to the primary structure of the c-terminus 1 gdrnflrfamide 2 aysnlnylrfamide 3 aqpsmrlrfamide sqpsmrlrfamide smpslrlrfamide and dgrtpalrlrfamide and 4 gyrkppfngsifamide these data indicate the high complexity of this peptide family in which multiple forms are usually exist
E,the amiloride binding protein abp is detected in many epithelium-rich andor hematopoietic tissues lingueglia e renard s voilley n waldmann r chassande o lazdunski m and barbry p 1993 eur j biochem 216 679-687 the protein binds amiloride and some of its derivatives such as phenamil benzamil and ethylpropylamiloride these properties have previously suggested that abp might be associated with an amiloride-sensitive na channel it corresponds in fact to an amiloride-sensitive diamine oxidase dao that catalyzes the degradation of compounds such as putrescine or histamine the analysis of the organization of the sequence of the human abpdao gene reveals that the 24-kilobase messenger rna is transcribed from two close origins identifying the proximal promoter after sequencing some corrections within the initial cdna sequence have been made human abpdao corresponds to a 751-residue polypeptide the promoter activity of 1800 base pairs upstream of the transcription start sites of the long form has been analyzed two bulks of cis-activating sequences have been identified one of them constitutes the proximal promoter it contains a palindromic sequence previously described as e-pal this motif is essential for the full activity of the promoter and behaves like a composite element this first molecular cloning of a human gene coding for a diamine oxidase will allow us to further understand its regulation during cell growth andor embryonic development
B,countless millions of people have died from tuberculosis a chronic infectious disease caused by the tubercle bacillus the complete genome sequence of the best-characterized strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv has been determined and analysed in order to improve our understanding of the biology of this slow-growing pathogen and to help the conception of new prophylactic and therapeutic interventions the genome comprises 4411529 base pairs contains around 4000 genes and has a very high guanine  cytosine content that is reflected in the blased amino-acid content of the proteins m tuberculosis differs radically from other bacteria in that a very large portion of its coding capacity is devoted to the production of enzymes involved in lipogenesis and lipolysis and to two new families of glycine-rich proteins with a repetitive structure that may represent a source of antigenic variation
A,to date eight closely related homologs of the escherichia coli umuc protein have been identified all of these homologs appear to play critical roles in damage-inducible mutagenesis in enterobacteriaceae recently a distantly related umuc-homolog dinb has also been identified in e coli using the polymerase chain reaction together with degenerate primers designed against conserved regions found in umuc-like proteins we have identified a new member of the umuc-superfamily in the archeon sulfolobus solfataricus this new homolog shows high sequence similarity to dinb and a lower level of similarity to umuc as a consequence we have called this new gene dbh dinb homolog analysis of approximately 27 kb dna encompassing the dbh region revealed several open reading frames orfs one encoding a putative ribokinase was located immediately upstream of dbh this orf overlaps the dbh gene by 4 bp suggesting that both proteins might be coordinately expressed further upstream of the ribokinase-dbh locus was another orf encoding a potential atpase homologous to two uncharacterized s cerevisiae proteins yd934602c and sc38kcxvi20 and another e coli dna repair protein ruvb while this is the first report of a umuc-like homolog in an archeon we detected additional homologs using protein sequence comparisons in gram-positive bacteria cyanobacteria and among potential human est products indicating that umuc-related proteins comprise a ubiquitous superfamily of proteins probably involved in dna repair and mutagenesis
B,an approach for genome analysis based on sequencing and assembly of unselected pieces of dna from the whole chromosome has been applied to obtain the complete nucleotide sequence 1830137 base pairs of the genome from the bacterium haemophilus influenzae rd this approach eliminates the need for initial mapping efforts and is therefore applicable to the vast array of microbial species for which genome maps are unavailable the h influenzae rd genome sequence genome sequence database accession number l42023 represents the only complete genome sequence from a free-living organism
E,amp deaminase ampd is characterized by a multigene family in rodents and man highly conserved rat and human ampd1 and ampd2 genes produce protein products that exhibit cross-species immunoreactivities ampd1 rat isoform a and human isoform m ampd2 rat isoform b and human isoform l a third gene ampd3 has been described in humans but antisera raised against its purified protein product isoform e reportedly does not cross-react with a third activity purified from rat tissues isoform c this study was designed to address this latter issue by cloning sequencing and expressing rat ampd3 cdna species similarly to the human ampd3 gene the rat ampd3 gene produces multiple transcripts that differ at or near their 5' ends the boundary at which these alternative sequences diverge is precisely conserved in both species across the region that is common to all rat and human ampd3 cdna species nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences are 89 and 93 identical respectively although the rat open reading frame is lacking two separate in-frame codons in the 5' end extreme 5' regions between the two species are entirely divergent and one alternative rat sequence is predicted to confer at least 36 additional n-terminal residues to its encoded ampd3 polypeptide a comparison of 3' untranslated regions indicates that the rat sequence is 250 bp longer and contains multiple consensus polyadenylation signals examination of relative rat ampd3 gene expression shows 1 variable patterns of alternative mrna abundance across adult tissues 2 developmental regulation in skeletal muscle and liver and 3 greater mrna abundance in adult red soleus than in mixed plantaris and white outer gastrocnemius skeletal muscle finally baculoviral expression of rat and human ampd3 proteins produces enzymes that are chromatographically and kinetically similar moreover both recombinant activities immunoreact with anti-c and anti-e serum these combined results demonstrate that rat isoform c and human isoform e are homologous cross-species ampd3 proteins
E,extant cetaceans are systematically divided into two suborders mysticeti baleen whales and odontoceti toothed whales in this study we have sequenced the complete mitochondrial mt genome of an odontocete the sperm whale physeter macrocephalus and included it in phylogenetic analyses together with the previously sequenced complete mtdnas of two mysticetes the fin and blue whales and a number of other mammals including five artiodactyls the hippopotamus cow sheep alpaca and pig the most strongly supported cetartiodactyl relationship was outgrouppig alpaca cow sheephippopotamussperm whalebaleen whales as in previous analyses of complete mtdnas the sister-group relationship between the hippopotamus and the whales received strong support making both artiodactyla and suiformes pigs peccaries and hippopotamuses paraphyletic in addition the analyses identified a sister-group relationship between suina the pig and tylopoda the alpaca although this relationship was not strongly supported the paleontological records of both mysticetes and odontocetes extend into the oligocene suggesting that the mysticete and odontocete lineages diverged 32-34 million years before present mybp use of this divergence date and the complete mtdnas of the sperm whale and the two baleen whales allowed the establishment of a new molecular reference om-33 for dating other eutherian divergences there was a general consistency between om-33 and the two previously established eutherian references ac-60 and er-50 cetacean whale origin ie the divergence between the hippopotamus and the cetaceans was dated to approximately 55 mybp while basal artiodactyl divergences were dated to 65 mybp molecular estimates of tertiary eutherian divergences were consistent with the fossil record
E,a novel protein p55cdc has been identified in cycling mammalian cells this transcript is readily detectable in all exponentially growing cell lines but disappears when cells are chemically induced to fall out of the cell cycle and differentiate the p55cdc protein appears to be essential for cell division since transfection of antisense p55cdc cdna into cho cells resulted in isolation of only those cells which exhibited a compensatory increase in p55cdc transcripts in the sense orientation immunoprecipitation of p55cdc yielded protein complexes with kinase activity which fluctuated during the cell cycle since p55cdc does not have the conserved protein kinase domains this activity must be due to one or more of the associated proteins in the immune complex the highest levels of protein kinase activity were seen with alpha-casein and myelin basic protein as substrates and demonstrated a pattern of activity distinct from that described for the known cyclin-dependent cell division kinases the p55cdc protein was also phosphorylated in dividing cells the amino acid sequence of p55cdc contains seven repeats homologous to the beta subunit of g proteins and the highest degree of homology in these repeats was found with the saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc20 and cdc4 proteins which have been proposed to be involved in the formation of a functional bipolar mitotic spindle in yeast cells the g beta repeat has been postulated to mediate protein-protein interactions and in p55cdc may modulate its association with a unique cell cycle protein kinase these findings suggest that p55cdc is a component of the mammalian cell cycle mechanism
E,we have characterized five human gamma-crystallin genes isolated from a genomic phage library dna sequencing of four of the genes revealed that two of them predict polypeptides of 174 residues showing 71 homology in their amino acid sequence the other two correspond to closely related pseudogenes which contain the same in-frame termination codon at identical positions in the coding sequence two of the genes and one of the pseudogenes are oriented in a head-to-tail fashion clustered within 225 kilobases all three contain a tata box 60 to 80 base pairs upstream of the initiation codon and a highly conserved segment of 44 base pairs in length immediately preceding the tata box the two genes and the two pseudogenes are similar in structure each contains a small 5' exon encoding three amino acids followed by two larger exons that correspond exactly to the two similar structural domains of the polypeptide the first intron varies from 100 to 110 base pairs and the second intron ranges from 1 to several kilobases rendering an overall gene size of 17 to 45 kilobases at least one of the two pseudogenes appears to have been functional before inactivation suggesting that their identical mutation was generated by gene conversion
E,the aminophospholipid translocase transports phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine from one side of a bilayer to another cloning of the gene encoding the enzyme identified a new subfamily of p-type atpases proposed to be amphipath transporters as reported here mammals express as many as 17 different genes from this subfamily phylogenetic analysis reveals the genes to be grouped into several distinct classes and subclasses to gain information on the functions represented by these groups northern analysis and in situ hybridization were used to examine the pattern of expression of a panel of subfamily members in the mouse the genes are differentially expressed in the respiratory digestive and urogenital systems endocrine organs the eye teeth and thymus with one exception all of the genes are highly expressed in the central nervous system cns however the pattern of expression within the cns differs substantially from gene to gene these results suggest that the genes are expressed in a tissue-specific manner are not simply redundant and may represent isoforms that transport a variety of different amphipaths
E,dead box proteins characterized by the conserved motif asp-glu-ala-asp are putative rna helicases implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of rna secondary structure such as translation initiation nuclear and mitochondrial splicing and ribosome and spliceosome assembly based on their distribution patterns some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis spermatogenesis and cellular growth and division here we report that the mrna encoding a dead box protein designated hudbp-rb is present at elevated levels in two of six retinoblastoma rb cell lines tested and is preferentially expressed in fetal tissues of neuroectodermal origin it is not possible to classify hudbp-rb as a member of any of the dead box protein subgroups identified to date since the regions of amino acid similarity between hudbp-rb and other dead box proteins are restricted to the conserved motifs found in all members of this family the hudbp-rb gene which has been mapped to chromosome band 2p24 is amplified in the rb cell lines that overexpress hudbp-rb rna furthermore the mycn gene is also present in multiple copies in these two cell lines suggesting coamplification of the two genes
B,we have sequenced the genome of shigella flexneri serotype 2a the most prevalent species and serotype that causes bacillary dysentery or shigellosis in man the whole genome is composed of a 4 607 203 bp chromosome and a 221 618 bp virulence plasmid designated pcp301 while the plasmid shows minor divergence from that sequenced in serotype 5a striking characteristics of the chromosome have been revealed the sflexneri chromosome has astonishingly 314 is elements more than 7-fold over those possessed by its close relatives the non-pathogenic k12 strain and enterohemorrhagic o157h7 strain of escherichia coli there are 13 translocations and inversions compared with the ecoli sequences all involve a segment larger than 5 kb and most are associated with deletions or acquired dna sequences of which several are likely to be bacteriophage-transmitted pathogenicity islands furthermore sflexneri resembling another human-restricted enteric pathogen salmonella typhi also has hundreds of pseudogenes compared with the ecoli strains all of these could be subjected to investigations towards novel preventative and treatment strategies against shigellosis
B,a 27-kilobase fragment of dna from oerskovia xanthineolytica containing the gene for a beta-13-glucanase has been isolated and its complete nucleotide sequence determined the sequence was found to contain two large open reading frames purification of the mature native enzyme and subsequent amino-terminal sequencing defined the glucanase gene in one reading frame which potentially encodes a protein of 548 amino acids we have expressed this glucanase gene in escherichia coli under control of the lacuv5 promoter and found the product to be secreted into the periplasm as a mature enzyme of about the same molecular weight as that of the native protein the recombinant enzyme was purified to near homogeneity by a single step of high performance liquid chromatography the ability of the recombinant enzyme to digest beta-glucan substrates and to lyse viable yeast cells was found to be indistinguishable from that of the native protein deletion of the cysteine-rich carboxyl-terminal 117 amino acids of the enzyme which also contain two duplicated segments abolished the lytic activity but did not significantly affect the glucanase function of the protein the possible involvement of this domain in interaction with the yeast cell wall is discussed
B,many isolates of the aeromonas species produce amonabactin a phenolate siderophore containing 23-dihydroxybenzoic acid 23-dhb an amonabactin biosynthetic gene amoa was identified in a sau3a1 gene library of aeromonas hydrophila 495a2 chromosomal dna by its complementation of the requirement of escherichia coli sab11 for exogenous 23-dhb to support siderophore enterobactin synthesis the gene amoa was subcloned as a sali-hindiii 34-kb dna fragment into psup202 and the complete nucleotide sequence of amoa was determined a putative iron-regulatory sequence resembling the fur repressor protein-binding site overlapped a possible promoter region a translational reading frame beginning with valine and encoding 396 amino acids was open for 1188 bp the c-terminal portion of the deduced amino acid sequence showed 58 identity and 79 similarity with the e coli entc protein isochorismate synthetase the first enzyme in the e coli 23-dhb biosynthetic pathway suggesting that amoa probably encodes a step in 23-dhb biosynthesis and is the a hydrophila equivalent of the e coli entc gene an isogenic amonabactin-negative mutant a hydrophila sb22 was isolated after marker exchange mutagenesis with tn5-inactivated amoa amoatn5 the mutant excreted neither 23-dhb nor amonabactin was more sensitive than the wild-type to growth inhibition by iron restriction and used amonabactin to overcome iron starvation
E,weighting strategies in a total evidence approach are often conducted in order to remove homoplasy with the implicit hope to increase congruence between data partitions incongruence was measured using the test of farris et al j s farris m kllersj a g kluge and c bult 1995 cladistics 10 315-319 within and between three mitochondrial genes from pitvipers crotalinae in partitioning each codon position for the coding genes incongruence between codon positions of a gene can be worse than incongruence between genes at analogous positions third positions of codons behave very differently in terms of incongruence from one gene to another while showing similar patterns in saturation tests instead of removing characters in order to discard homoplasy which is hopeless and does not increase general congruence we advocate for the removal of those substitutions that are incongruent with the rest the genus calloselasma and its sister group the genus hypnale are the most basal crotalinae asiatic pitvipers are paraphyletic while american pitvipers are monophyletic
E,in the present article we report the purification and the amino acid sequence of two antibacterial peptides present in the secretion of the female reproductive accessory glands of the dipteran insect ceratitis capitata both peptides consist of 29 amino acid residues are heat stable strongly basic and differ from each other for the substitution of two amino acids their primary sequence and predicted secondary structure are related to other families of peptides known to have lytic andor antibacterial activity we propose the name ceratotoxins from ceratitis for these antibacterial peptides
V,the complete nucleotide sequence of virion dna from two isolates of woodchuck hepatitis virus whv 7 and whv 59 was determined along with the sequence of supercoiled dna from one of those isolates whv 7 the sequences of the two whv isolates were compared with the previously published sequences of two other isolates whv 1 and whv 8 the range of nucleotide sequence variation of the four isolates 1 to 35 was similar to those of hbvs of the same subtype 15 to 2 but less than those of hbvs of different subtypes 8 to 10 when amino acid sequences from the four whv isolates were aligned a consensus sequence could not be obtained at 13 sites at 11 of 13 sites 7 in polymerase 2 in presurface 1 in surface and 1 in the x region the viruses could be grouped into pairs so that whv 1 and whv 59 shared one amino acid andor whv 7 and whv 8 shared a different amino acid whv 7 was passaged twice in woodchucks and supercoiled dna was isolated the nucleotide sequence of whv 7 supercoiled dna derived from liver was compared to that of whv 7 virion dna derived from serum sequence comparison of virion and free supercoiled dna from whv 7 showed no nucleotide changes except for a single nucleotide deletion thought to represent an error during molecular cloning or a defective viral genome thus the nucleotide sequence of two different replicative forms of whv dna separated by two in vivo passages were virtually identical
E,five novel neuropeptides designated pm-sgp-i to -v of the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone chh family have been identified from the giant tiger prawn penaeus monodon by isolation of the preprohormone genes from an eyestalk complementary dna library on the basis of sequence similarity the encoded peptides have been classified as chh-like type i hormones which include all known chhs and the molt-inhibiting hormone mih of the lobster homarus americanus consistent with chh type i preprohormones the pm-sgp precursors include a signal peptide a chh precursor-related peptide cprp and the chh-like hormone analysis by electrospray ionization-fourier transform mass spectrometry enabled the neuropeptide complement of individual sinus glands to be resolved it also confirmed the presence of the five pm-sgp neuropeptides within the sinus gland of an individual animal in that the masses observed were consistent with those predicted from the gene sequence of the pm-sgps after posttranslational modification these modifications included cleavage of the signal peptide and precursor protein carboxy-terminal amidation and formation of three disulfide bridges analysis of crude extracts of single sinus glands from different animals revealed variation in neuropeptide content and will provide a tool for determining whether the content varies as a function of the physiological state of the animal
E,the isolation purification and biochemical characterization of the novel peptide contryphan-vn extracted from the venom of the mediterranean marine snail conus ventricosus is reported contryphan-vn is the first conus peptide described from a vermivorous species and the first purified from the venom of the single mediterranean conus species the amino acid sequence of contryphan-vn is as with other contryphans contryphan-vn contains a d-tryptophan residue is amidated at the c-terminus and maintains the five-residue intercystine loop size however contryphan-vn differs from the known contryphans by the insertion of the asp residue at position 2 by the lack of hydroxylation of pro4 and remarkably by the presence of the basic residue lys6 within the intercystine loop although the biological functions of contryphans is still unknown these characteristics suggest distinct molecular targets andor functions for contryphan-vn
E,we have identified 52 novel human cadherin-like genes organized into three closely linked clusters comparison of the genomic dna sequences with those of representative cdnas reveals a striking genomic organization similar to that of immunoglobulin and t cell receptor gene clusters the n-terminal extracellular and transmembrane domains of each cadherin protein are encoded by a distinct and unusually large exon these exons are organized in a tandem array by contrast the c-terminal cytoplasmic domain of each protein is identical and is encoded by three small exons located downstream from the cluster of n-terminal exons this unusual organization has interesting implications regarding the molecular code required to establish complex networks of neuronal connections in the brain and the mechanisms of cell-specific cadherin-like gene expression
B,the gram-negative bacterium yersinia pestis is the causative agent of the systemic invasive infectious disease classically referred to as plague and has been responsible for three human pandemics the justinian plague sixth to eighth centuries the black death fourteenth to nineteenth centuries and modern plague nineteenth century to the present day the recent identification of strains resistant to multiple drugs and the potential use of y pestis as an agent of biological warfare mean that plague still poses a threat to human health here we report the complete genome sequence of y pestis strain co92 consisting of a 465-megabase mb chromosome and three plasmids of 962 kilobases kb 703 kb and 96 kb the genome is unusually rich in insertion sequences and displays anomalies in gc base-composition bias indicating frequent intragenomic recombination many genes seem to have been acquired from other bacteria and viruses including adhesins secretion systems and insecticidal toxins the genome contains around 150 pseudogenes many of which are remnants of a redundant enteropathogenic lifestyle the evidence of ongoing genome fluidity expansion and decay suggests y pestis is a pathogen that has undergone large-scale genetic flux and provides a unique insight into the ways in which new and highly virulent pathogens evolve
E,hla-b15 embraces a multiplicity of antigenic specificities which vary in their distribution amongst human populations to correlate b15 molecular structure with the serological picture we have sequenced alleles encoding the various subspecificities of the b15 antigen b62 b63 b75 b76 and b77 and a number of variants of these antigens including the 8w66 split of b63 hla-b63 b1517 and 8w66 b1516 heavy chains have sequence identity to b17 in the alpha 1 helix correlating with the antigenic crossreactivity of these molecules hla-b77b1513 and b75 b1502 heavy chains differ solely in segments determining the bw4 and bw6 public epitopes consistent with the serological description of the b77 and b75 antigens one allele encoding the b76 antigen b1512 appears to be the product of gene conversion between the hla-a and -b loci and differs from b1501 in codons 166 and 167 in contrast a second allele encoding the b76 antigen b1514 differs from b1501 by an unrelated substitution in codon 167 which confers similarily with b45 an antigen crossreactive with b76 a third allele encoding b76 b1519 differs from b1512 by a unique point substitution in exon 4 three alleles encoding variant b15 and b62 antigens b1508 b1511 and b1515 differ from b1501 by localized clusters of substitutions that probably result from interallelic conversion the b15 sequences described in this paper in combination with those previously determined define a family of 22 alleles including those encoding the b46 and b70 antigens within this family the patterns of allelic substitution are analogous to those of other hla-a and -b families in that pairwise differences almost always involve functional positions of the antigen recognition site and recombination is the major agent of diversification
E,we have used a combination of subtractive cloning and differential screening techniques to identify genes preferentially expressed in early stages of human tnk cell development compared with mature t and nk cells a fetal liver-derived cytoplasmic c cd3 membrane m cd3- clone fl508 which expresses markers characteristic of pre-t and pre-nk cells served as a cell source for our cloning experiments a cdna library enriched for genes expressed in fl508 was constructed by removal of cdna that hybridized to mrna from a b cell line jy one-tenth of the resulting library of 5000 clones was screened by differential hybridization with cdna probes from jy and a mature cd4 t cell clone b21 the relative expression levels of six selected clones were analyzed in 17 different celltissue types by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction four of these clones are expressed at higher levels in thymocytes than in mature t or nk cells and three clones are expressed at higher levels in fetal liver cells than in either mature t or nk cells partial and complete dna sequence information suggests that these six cdna correspond to previously unidentified genes genes identified in this study may be useful not only as markers for early stages of tnk cell ontogeny but also as tools for understanding novel developmental events
B,the escherichia coli gene encoding one of the primosomal proteins protein i was cloned by the use of synthetic oligonucleotide probes nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a coding region for protein i of 537 base pairs preceded by a possible promoter sequence the gene is located adjacent to the dnac locus probably both being in a single operon the protein i gene was shown to be closely related to the dnat locus based on the following observations i a multicopy plasmid carrying only the protein i gene suppresses the temperature-sensitive phenotype of a dnat strain and restores the ability of the strain to carry out stable dna replication in the absence of protein synthesis ii an extract from a dnat strain does not support replication of the plasmid pbr322 in vitro addition of purified protein i restores its activity these results indicate that protein i is encoded by dnat and that it is essential for chromosomal dna replication and is involved in the induction of stable dna replication during the sos response
E,stefins or type 1 cystatins belong to a large evolutionarily conserved protein superfamily the members of which inhibit the papain-like cysteine proteinases we report here on the molecular cloning and chromosomal localization of three newly identified members of the murine stefin gene family these genes designated herein as mouse stefins 1 2 and 3 were isolated on the basis of their relatively increased expression in moth-eaten viable compared to normal congenic mouse bone marrow cells the open reading frames of the stefin cdnas encode proteins of approximately 115 kda that show between 50 and 92 identity to sequences of stefins isolated from various other species data from southern analysis suggest that the murine stefin gene family encompasses at least 6 and possibly 10-20 members all of which appear to be clustered in the genome analysis of interspecific backcross mice indicates that the genes encoding the three mouse stefins all map to mouse chromosome 16 a localization that is consistent with the recent assignment of the human stefin a gene to a region of conserved homology between human chromosome 3q and the proximal region of mouse chromosome 16
E,the purpose of this study was to detect genetic variation in the porcine h-fabp gene a candidate gene for meat quality traits in pigs lambda phages containing the porcine h-fabp gene were isolated by plaque hybridization with human h-fabp cdna the coding and flanking intronic sequences of the porcine h-fabp gene were determined as well as 16 kb of the 5' upstream region the various potential regulatory sequences in this region are in accordance with the function and expression of the protein in muscle and mammary tissue furthermore comparison with the homolog region of the mouse identified a highly conserved 13-bp element cttcct ac tttcgg that may be involved in regulation of expression the porcine h-fabp gene was localized on chromosome chr 6 by porcine sequence-specific pcr on dna from a pigrodent cell hybrid panel in addition part of the h-fabp gene was screened for genetic variation by pcr-rflp analysis three pcr-rflps were detected one in the upstream region hinfi and two in the second intron haeiii and mspi in most pig breeds the corresponding alleles have a variable distribution possibly a consequence of selective breeding this genetic variation will enable us to investigate the role of the h-fabp locus in porcine production and meat quality traits
E,tie2 is a receptor-like tyrosine kinase expressed almost exclusively in endothelial cells and early hemopoietic cells and required for the normal development of vascular structures during embryogenesis we report the identification of a secreted ligand for tie2 termed angiopoietin-1 using a novel expression cloning technique that involves intracellular trapping and detection of the ligand in cos cells the structure of angiopoietin-1 differs from that of known angiogenic factors or other ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases although angiopoietin-1 binds and induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of tie2 it does not directly promote the growth of cultured endothelial cells however its expression in close proximity with developing blood vessels implicates angiopoietin-1 in endothelial developmental processes
B,a gene encoding 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase 6-pgdh ec 111 44 was identified from the homofermentative lactic acid bacterium lactococcus lactis by complementation of escherichia coli mutants the cloned gene was then expressed to high levels in e coli and the protein purified for kinetic analysis the enzyme had a km for 6-phosphogluconate of 154-14 microm and for nadp of 19-02 microm at ph 75 sequence comparison of the l lactis 6-pgdh with the corresponding enzyme derived from the pathogenic protozoan trypanosoma brucei and sheep liver revealed the substrate-binding residues to be identical in all three species although the three coenzyme-binding pockets differed slightly a totally conserved arginine residue arg-447 believed to bind the 6-phosphate of substrate was mutated to lysine aspartate alanine or tryptophan in each case enzyme activity was lost confirming an essential role for this residue on activity a second arginine arg-34 believed to be critical in binding the 2'-phosphate of cofactor nadp was mutated to a tyrosine residue as found in one atypical isoform of the enzyme in bacillus subtilis this alteration led to decrease in affinity for nadp of nearly three orders of magnitude a second 6-pgdh gene has been identified from the genome of b subtilis this second isoform contains an arginine arg-34 in this position suggesting that b subtilis has two 6-pgdhs with different coenzyme specificities
B,we describe here the complete genome sequence 1111523 base pairs of the obligate intracellular parasite rickettsia prowazekii the causative agent of epidemic typhus this genome contains 834 protein-coding genes the functional profiles of these genes show similarities to those of mitochondrial genes no genes required for anaerobic glycolysis are found in either r prowazekii or mitochondrial genomes but a complete set of genes encoding components of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the respiratory-chain complex is found in r prowazekii in effect atp production in rickettsia is the same as that in mitochondria many genes involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of biosynthesis of amino acids and nucleosides in free-living bacteria are absent from r prowazekii and mitochondria such genes seem to have been replaced by homologues in the nuclear host genome the r prowazekii genome contains the highest proportion of non-coding dna 24 detected so far in a microbial genome such non-coding sequences may be degraded remnants of 'neutralized' genes that await elimination from the genome phylogenetic analyses indicate that r prowazekii is more closely related to mitochondria than is any other microbe studied so far
E,we have identified a cdna encoding human peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase pam ec 114173 with a total length of 3748 bp by screening of a human thyroid carcinoma lambda gt11 library using two heterologous oligonucleotides to conserved regions which derived from frog skin and bovine pituitary pam sequences furthermore we have identified a sequence which differs in a 321 bp deletion cos cells transfected with a truncated form of this cdna lacking the putative carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domain generated a functional pam that showed a 20-fold increase of the activity compared to the control and was visualized by immunoblotting
B,the nucleotide sequence of bacillus subtilis chef was corrected it encodes an 18-kda protein that is homologous to flij a protein required for formation of basal bodies in escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium methanol release is abnormal in chef mutants suggesting that the morphology and functioning of the motor affects methanol formation
B,thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis is a rod-shaped gram-negative anaerobic eubacterium that was isolated from a freshwater hot spring in tengchong china using a whole-genome-shotgun method we sequenced its 2689445-bp genome from an isolate mb4t genbank accession no ae008691 the genome encodes 2588 predicted coding sequences cds among them 1764 682 are classified according to homology to other documented proteins and the rest 824 cds 318 are functionally unknown one of the interesting features of the t tengcongensis genome is that 867 of its genes are encoded on the leading strand of dna replication based on protein sequence similarity the t tengcongensis genome is most similar to that of bacillus halodurans a mesophilic eubacterium among all fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes up to date computational analysis on genes involved in basic metabolic pathways supports the experimental discovery that t tengcongensis metabolizes sugars as principal energy and carbon source and utilizes thiosulfate and element sulfur but not sulfate as electron acceptors t tengcongensis as a gram-negative rod by empirical definitions such as staining shares many genes that are characteristics of gram-positive bacteria whereas it is missing molecular components unique to gram-negative bacteria a strong correlation between the g  c content of tdna and rdna genes and the optimal growth temperature is found among the sequenced thermophiles it is concluded that thermophiles are a biologically and phylogenetically divergent group of prokaryotes that have converged to sustain extreme environmental conditions over evolutionary timescale
B,the complete nucleotide sequence of the genome of a symbiotic bacterium bradyrhizobium japonicum usda110 was determined the genome of b japonicum was a single circular chromosome 9105828 bp in length with an average gc content of 641 no plasmid was detected the chromosome comprises 8317 potential protein-coding genes one set of rrna genes and 50 trna genes fifty-two percent of the potential protein genes showed sequence similarity to genes of known function and 30 to hypothetical genes the remaining 18 had no apparent similarity to reported genes thirty-four percent of the b japonicum genes showed significant sequence similarity to those of both mesorhizobium loti and sinorhizobium meliloti while 23 were unique to this species a presumptive symbiosis island 681 kb in length which includes a 410-kb symbiotic region previously reported by gttfert et al was identified six hundred fifty-five putative protein-coding genes were assigned in this region and the functions of 301 genes including those related to symbiotic nitrogen fixation and dna transmission were deduced a total of 167 genes for transposases104 copies of insertion sequences were identified in the genome it was remarkable that 100 out of 167 transposase genes are located in the presumptive symbiotic island dna segments of 4 to 97 kb inserted into trna genes were found at 14 locations in the genome which generates partial duplication of the target trna genes these observations suggest plasticity of the b japonicum genome which is probably due to complex genome rearrangements such as horizontal transfer and insertion of various dna elements and to homologous recombination
E,the ligand binding site of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor achr is located in the alpha-subunit within a small fragment containing the tandem cysteines at positions 192 and 193 we have been analyzing the binding site domain of achrs from several animal species exhibiting various degrees of resistance to alpha-bungarotoxin alpha-btx our earlier work on the snake and mongoose achr both of which do not bind alpha-btx suggested that amino acid substitutions at positions 187 189 and 194 of the achr alpha-subunit are important in determining the resistance of these achrs to alpha-btx in the present study we have examined the correlation between alpha-btx binding and the structure of the binding site domain of achr from the hedgehog shrew cat and human fragments of the achr alpha-subunit corresponding to residues 122-205 from these species were cloned sequenced and expressed in escherichia coli the hedgehog fragment does not bind alpha-btx in common with the snake and mongoose achr and the human fragment is a partial binder the shrew and cat fragments bind alpha-btx to a similar extent as the mouse fragment the hedgehog and human achrs have nonaromatic amino acid residues at positions 187 and 189 of the alpha-subunit as is seen with the toxin resistant snake and mongoose and in contrast with the toxin binders which have aromatic residues at these two positionsabstract truncated at 250 words
B,the nucleotide sequence of the bacillus subtilis flim gene has been determined this gene encodes a 38-kda protein that is homologous to the flim flagellar switch proteins of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium expression of this gene in che cells of e coli and b subtilis interferes with normal chemotaxis the nature of the chemotaxis defect is dependent upon the host used in b subtilis overproduction of flim generates mostly nonmotile cells those cells that are motile switch less frequently expression of b subtilis flim in e coli also generates nonmotile cells however those cells that are motile have a tumble bias the b subtilis flim gene cannot complement an e coli flim mutant a frameshift mutation was constructed in the flim gene and the mutation was transferred onto the b subtilis chromosome the mutant has a fla- phenotype this phenotype is consistent with the hypothesis that the flim protein encodes a component of the flagellar switch in b subtilis additional characterization of the flim mutant suggests that the hag and mot loci are not expressed these loci are regulated by the sigd form of rna polymerase we also did not observe any methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins in an in vivo methylation experiment the expression of these proteins is also dependent upon sigd it is possible that a functional basal body-hook complex may be required for the expression of sigd-regulated chemotaxis and motility genes
E,the higher plant arabidopsis thaliana arabidopsis is an important model for identifying plant genes and determining their function to assist biological investigations and to define chromosome structure a coordinated effort to sequence the arabidopsis genome was initiated in late 1996 here we report one of the first milestones of this project the sequence of chromosome 4 analysis of 1738 megabases of unique sequence representing about 17 of the genome reveals 3744 protein coding genes 81 transfer rnas and numerous repeat elements heterochromatic regions surrounding the putative centromere which has not yet been completely sequenced are characterized by an increased frequency of a variety of repeats new repeats reduced recombination lowered gene density and lowered gene expression roughly 60 of the predicted protein-coding genes have been functionally characterized on the basis of their homology to known genes many genes encode predicted proteins that are homologous to human and caenorhabditis elegans proteins
E,the genome of the model plant arabidopsis thaliana has been sequenced by an international collaboration the arabidopsis genome initiative here we report the complete sequence of chromosome 5 this chromosome is 26 megabases long it is the second largest arabidopsis chromosome and represents 21 of the sequenced regions of the genome the sequence of chromosomes 2 and 4 have been reported previously and that of chromosomes 1 and 3 together with an analysis of the complete genome sequence are reported in this issue analysis of the sequence of chromosome 5 yields further insights into centromere structure and the sequence determinants of heterochromatin condensation the 5874 genes encoded on chromosome 5 reveal several new functions in plants and the patterns of gene organization provide insights into the mechanisms and extent of genome evolution in plants
E,we report here the isolation of a new member of the adp-ribosylation factor arf-like family arl-6 present in the j2e erythroleukemic cell line but not its myeloid variants consistent with this lineage-restricted expression arl-6 mrna increased with erythropoietin-induced maturation of j2e cells and decreased with interleukin 6-induced differentiation of m1 monoblastoid cells in tissues arl-6 mrna was most abundant in brain and kidney while arl-6 protein was predominantly cytosolic its membrane association increased following exposure to gtp-gammas like many members of the arfarl family using the yeast two-hybrid system six molecules which interact with arl-6 were identified including sec61beta a subunit of the heterotrimeric protein conducting channel sec61p co-immunoprecipitation of arl-6 confirmed a stable association between arl-6 and sec61beta in cos cells these results demonstrate that arl-6 a novel member of the adp-ribosylation factor-like family interacts with the sec61beta subunit
E,three different cdnas prh-19 prh-26 and prh-43 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate paps reductase homolog have been isolated by complementation of an escherichia coli cysh mutant defective in paps reductase activity to prototrophy with an arabidopsis thaliana cdna library in the expression vector lambda yes sequence analysis of the cdnas revealed continuous open reading frames encoding polypeptides of 465 458 and 453 amino acids with calculated molecular masses of 513 505 and 504 kda respectively that have strong homology with fungal yeast and bacterial paps reductases however unlike microbial paps reductases each prh protein has an n-terminal extension characteristic of a plastid transit peptide and a c-terminal extension that has amino acid and deduced three-dimensional homology to thioredoxin proteins adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate aps was shown to be a much more efficient substrate than paps when the activity of the prh proteins was tested by their ability to convert 35s-labeled substrate to acid-volatile 35s-sulfite we speculate that the thioredoxin-like domain is involved in catalytic function and that the prh proteins may function as novel aps reductase enzymes southern hybridization analysis showed the presence of a small multigene family in the arabidopsis genome rna blot hybridization with gene-specific probes revealed for each gene the presence of a transcript of approximately 185 kb in leaves stems and roots that increased on sulfate starvation to our knowledge this is the first report of the cloning and characterization of plant genes that encode proteins with aps reductase activity and supports the suggestion that aps can be utilized directly without activation to paps as an intermediary substrate in reductive sulfate assimilation
